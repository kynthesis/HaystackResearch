All other characters were created just for the film by the movie's writers.",Iron Man (2008)
"Why was the fighter pilot's chute jammed during the ""training exercise"" scene?","First, it's a very common plot device in action movies: the parachute ejector seat that fails or the parachute that fails to deploy. Great way to create tension in an action sequence like this.

In this case, it looks like a malfunction with the lever that the pilot has to yank on to release his chute: it's probably bent in such a way that he can't pull up on it.",Iron Man (2008)
What is 'Iron Man' about?,"When wealthy industrialist Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) suffers a chestful of shrapnel after his Humvee is bombed by enemy fire in Afghanistan where he has gone to give a presentation of the new Jericho missile that Stark Industries has developed, his life is saved only by an electromagnet attached to a car battery that serves to keep the shrapnel from piercing his heart. Tony escapes from his captors by creating an arc reactor that eliminates the need for the battery and an iron suit that protects him from attack. Back in the U.S., he announces that his company will cease making weapons, and he begins work on an updated armored suit, all to the chagrin of his partner Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges).",Iron Man (2008)
"Is ""Iron Man"" based on a book?","Iron Man is based on a comic book of the same name created by Marvel Comics editor Stan Lee and artists Don Heck and Jack Kirby. Iron Man first appeared in issue #39 of Tales of Suspense (March 1963). The screenplay for the film was written by Mark Fergus, Hawk Ostby, Art Marcum, and Matt Holloway. Iron Man was followed by Iron Man 2 (2010) (2010) and Iron Man Three (2013) (2013).",Iron Man (2008)
Who or what is the Invincible Iron Man?,"Iron Man is the alias used by billionaire industrialist, inventor, military contractor, philanthropist, adventurer and socialite, Tony Stark. By day, Stark is the majority shareholder, CEO, chief technologist and de facto head of Stark International, a multinational conglomerate of technology companies. Stark International's primary businesses are research and development, weapons manufacturing, engineering, computer software and consumer electronics. Stark transforms himself into Iron Man when he dons his revolutionary suit of powered armor to fight crime and injustice. The Iron Man grants Stark superhuman strength, invulnerability, supersonic-flight capabilities and access to a vast array of directed energy weapons (including Stark's own proprietary repulsor-ray technology). The suit is controlled cybernetically by the wearer (as in the mechanisms of perception and control are similar to that of the natural relationship between the natural brain and the rest of the natural body). It also features a sophisticated operating system which employs some artificial intelligence.",Iron Man (2008)
Can Iron Man be considered a cyborg?,"In common parlance, no; Iron Man is not a cyborg. He is not much more of a cyborg than a person who wears glasses or contact lenses. A cyborg or cybernetic being, as commonly depicted in science fiction, e.g., RoboCop (1987) (1987), The Terminator (1984) (1984), The Six Million Dollar Man (1973) (1973), and Darth Vader from Star Wars (1977) (1977), is a (chiefly cybernetic and often inseparable) fusion of living tissue and synthetic components. This interactive synthesis of organic and artificial systems can produce, for an organic lifeform, a wide variety of effects including, but not limited to, enhanced strength, speed, reflexes, endurance, intelligence etc. Iron Man is a ""superhero persona"", a man who is wearing/operating a suit of powered armor (an ""exoskeleton"") that could be worn by different people. Stark does, however, have an embedded chest piece, intended as a lifesaving device and capable of interacting with and powering the armor.",Iron Man (2008)
What kind of jet is Tony Stark's private jet?,"It is a Boeing 737-800. However, the tail section is CGI-altered to make it appear more futuristic. Stark, being a technology wiz and a billionaire, would jump at the chance to have a sleeker and more modern plane than anyone else.",Iron Man (2008)
Who are the villain(s) in 'Iron Man'?,"Iron Man's primary nemesis is Obadiah Stane, aka the Iron Monger. In the beginning of the movie, Stark is captured by a group of terrorists known as ""The Ten Rings"". The Ten Rings is a reference to long time Iron Man nemesis, The Mandarin, who wields ten directed-energy-based rings as weapons.",Iron Man (2008)
Which armors are featured in the film?,"The three armors featured are the Mark I, Mark II and Mark III. The Mark I armor is the gray incarnation of the Diving Bell Armor Stark was forced to produce while in captivity. It is bullet resistant and features flamethrowers as its primary weapon. It also has limited flight capability. The Mark II armor features a more streamlined design, flight capabilities and directed energy weapons. It has a monochrome silver-metallic finish. The Mark III is essentially a duplicate of Mark II revised with the trademark red and gold color scheme known to the majority of fans. The Mark III armor compensates for a design flaw in the Mark II design which allowed for ""icing"" to occur during high-altitude flights.",Iron Man (2008)
Does this movie mention Tony Stark's alcohol issues?,"No, but we do see Tony Stark drinking often. Several characters also have recollections of Tony being inebriated during events that take place prior to the film's timeline.",Iron Man (2008)
"Why does Tony ask for one of the vodka martinis to be ""dirty""?","Presumably because he likes it that way. A standard vodka martini contains vodka, vermouth and an olive, and is crystal clear in color; a ""dirty"" martini is one that uses olive brine in place of or alongside the vermouth, and appears cloudier in color.",Iron Man (2008)
Is this in the same universe as the rest of the Marvel movies?,"Only some of them. All cinematic material made under the Marvel Studios banner, e.g., Iron Man (2008), The Incredible Hulk (2008), Thor (2011) and Captain America: The First Avenger (2011), are all set in the same universe (known as the Marvel Cinematic Universe), with the characters crossing over (most notably S.H.I.E.L.D. personnel-Fury, Coulson, Romanoff or Barton), culminating in The Avengers (2012) which ties these films together. Marvel Studios also owns / owned The Punisher and Blade, however The Punisher (2004), Punisher: War Zone (2008), Blade (1998), Blade II (2002) and Blade: Trinity (2004) are / were not in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Other Marvel-based films owned by other studios are not set in the MCU, due to differing ownership. This includes, for example: Spider-Man (2002) and Ghost Rider (2007) (both owned by Sony); X-Men (2000), Fantastic Four (2005), and Daredevil (2003) (all owned by Fox).",Iron Man (2008)
What does S.H.I.E.L.D. stand for?,"In this film it stands for ""Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division"". Several characters joke about the length, which leads to the creation of the acronym, SHIELD. In the comics, it is ""Supreme Headquarters, International Espionage, Law-enforcement Division"" from 1965 until 1991 when it changed its name to ""Strategic Hazard Intervention, Espionage Logistics Directorate"". In the popular 1990s Spider-Man cartoon that aired on Fox Kids, it was identified as ""Strategical Hazard International Espionage Law-enforcement Division"".",Iron Man (2008)
Why didn't Nick Fury appear in preview screenings?,"In an Entertainment Weekly interview, Jon Favreau says that Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige ordered the scene cut out of previews in order to keep fans guessing.",Iron Man (2008)
Why was Samuel L. Jackson cast in the role of Nick Fury? Isn't Fury Caucasian in the comic books?,"The portrayal of Colonel Nicholas Joseph ""Nick"" Fury by Sam Jackson is based on the Ultimate Marvel Universe interpretation of the character. Ultimate Fury was intentionally patterned after the veteran actor after obtaining his consent to do so. This casting decision has proven controversial amongst continuity purists, despite the fact that it is not the first time such a deviation from original canon has occurred. Wilson Fisk (aka the Kingpin of Crime), a Caucasian character, was portrayed by Michael Clarke Duncan, an American actor of Black descent, in the 2003 adaptation of Daredevil. The Ultimate Marvel Universe is a continuity that is separate and distinct from the classic Marvel Universe. The Ultimate imprint features revisionist versions of characters and stories which are featured in, and originally took place in, classic Marvel continuity. The Marvel Ultimate imprint prefixes all of its characters, scenarios and titles with the word ""Ultimate"" (e.g. Ultimate Spider-Man, Ultimate Iron Man, Ultimate Marvel Team-Up, Ultimate Adventures, etc). Most Ultimate characters only bear the name and basic origin of their classic counterparts. Other details such as powers, appearance, personality and modus operandi are vastly different. To distinguish the two different continuities, some fans refer to classic Marvel Universe continuity as the ""616 Universe"". Nick Fury (played by Jackson) appears in a post end-credits sting where he confronts Tony Stark in his residence and says he wants to talk about ""The Avengers Initiative."" Also as a result of Jackson's involvement with the film series, it led to a new character named Nick Fury Jr. to be introduced into the Mainstream universe as a means to phase out the classic version from the franchise. More Information: Ultimate Iron Man, Ultimate Nick Fury, Ultimate Marvel, Earth-616, and Nick Fury Jr.",Iron Man (2008)
"What are the main differences between the ""Iron Man"" film and comic book properties?","There are many differences between the film and comic book properties, the primary differences between the two are documented as follows. In the comics, Ho Yinsen—the man who helped Tony build the first Iron Man suit—was Chinese. The film's Yinsen (Shaun Toub) is Afghani, from the fictional town of Gulmira. However, Yinsen is a Chinese name and it would be unlikely for an Afghan to be so named. Obadiah Stane, in the comics, was a rival businessman, and had his own company, Stane International. However, like his film incarnation, he was friendly with Tony's father before his passing. The group that kidnaps Tony Stark is implied to be connected to the Mandarin, Iron Man's archenemy. The Mandarin had nothing to do with his kidnapping in the comics (well, not directly, anyway). The Ten Rings are also involved with Obadiah Stane, who personally ordered the hit on Tony Stark. This is not the case in the comic book series. Jim Rhodes was a full-bird Colonel in the United States Marine Corps when he first appeared in the comics, while in the film he is a Lt. Colonel in the Air Force. JARVIS, the A.I. featured in the film, is a flesh and blood butler in the comic books.",Iron Man (2008)
Why does Tony Stark act the way he does during the last press conference?,"During the press conference at the end, Tony Stark hesitates to use SHIELD's cover story and then blurts out, ""I am Iron Man."" As to why he does this, an excerpt from the novelization offers some insight:

He thinks about how lying and deceit from others has brought him to this pass. He has sworn to put an end to that sort of thing, to do away with underhandedness and double-dealing. With the sort of mind-set that resulted in weapons being secretly sold to enemies and destroying lives.

People don't really know what happened last night. More questions will be raised, and more. There has to be an end to fear, and an end to secrecy, or otherwise this wreck of a world is going to be the best they've got and it's only going to get worse.

And the honesty, the transforming of the unknown into the known, the upfront dealings with people...it has to start somewhere.

Up until the publication of Iron Man vol. 3 issue #55, where Tony Stark reveals his identity, the media spin was that Iron Man was Tony Stark's bodyguard. Given the character's tendency towards impulsive and risky behavior, his sudden revelation is not out of character.",Iron Man (2008)
How does the movie end?,"Tony orders Pepper to overload the large arc reactor in the building even though he is still on the roof. Pepper is hesitant but obeys. The reactor releases its shockwave, knocking out the Iron Monger and killing Stane. The mini arc reactor in Tony's chest sparks back to life, allowing him to survive. The press subsequently lauds the ""Iron Man"" as a hero. Tony likes the moniker, even though his suit is made of a gold-titanium alloy. Agent Coulson (Clark Gregg) invents a cover story telling the ""truth"" about the destruction of the Stark Building: a robotic prototype malfunctioned and caused damage to the arc reactor, Stark was on his yacht in Avalon Island, Stane was killed in a small aircraft accrident while on vacation, and the Iron Man was Stark's bodyguard. In the final scene, Tony is about to report Coulson's cover story at a press conference but tosses away his prepared statement and says only, ""I am Iron Man.""",Iron Man (2008)
Is there a scene after the credits?,"Yes. Tony returns home to find a mysterious man in black awaiting him. He introduces himself as Nick Fury, director of SHIELD. He points out that Tony is not the only superhero in existence and wants to talk about him joining the ""Avenger Initiative.""",Iron Man (2008)
Who are the Avengers?,"The original Avengers consisted of Ant-Man, Wasp, Thor, Iron Man and the Incredible Hulk. Captain America joined the group in Volume 1 of The Avengers, Issue number 4, and replaced the Hulk.",Iron Man (2008)
Is it true Captain America's shield appears in the movie?,"Yes. During the scene after Colonel Rhodes gives his ""training exercise"" cover story to the press, Tony Stark is in the middle of removing his damaged suit. What appears to be a partially built, shield-like apparatus with an American flag design and a star in the middle can be seen in Stark's work area just before Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) discovers him. Producer Kevin Feige has stated that it is, indeed, Captain America's shield. Blink and you'll miss it!",Iron Man (2008)
Does Iron Man appear in 'The Incredible Hulk'?,"Yes. Tony Stark puts in an appearance at the end of The Incredible Hulk (2008), which suggests that a team is being formed, most likely ""The Avengers."" In fact, the post-credits scene (i.e., the stinger) makes reference to the ""Avengers Initiative.""",Iron Man (2008)
Where is Stan Lee's cameo in this movie?,"As Tony Stark arrives at his third annual benefit for the Firefighter's Family Fund, he pats Stan Lee who presents like Hugh Hefner, i.e. wearing a bathrobe and having a supermodel at each of his arms.",Iron Man (2008)
What are the names of all of the songs that have been featured in Iron Man trailers?,"Hell Above Water by English alternative duo Curve

Which characters were adapted from Marvel's The Incredible Hulk comic books?,"For this list only the creators of the characters first appearances are listed. As with all comic book characters, The Incredible Hulk and his supporting cast have had several reinventions and different contributions from different writers. Theses include different iterations in different mediums that all have added different concepts to the overall mythology of the characters.

Theirs Robert Bruce Banner/The Hulk, referred to as Bruce Banner or The Hulk on screen. He made his first appearance in the comic story ""The Hulk"" from The Incredible Hulk #1 (May 1962) by writer Stan Lee and artist Jack Kirby.

Elizabeth ""Betty"" Ross, referred to as Betty Ross on screen. She made her first appearance in the comic story ""The Hulk"" from The Incredible Hulk #1 (May 1962) by writer Stan Lee and artist Jack Kirby.

Emil Blonsky/Abomination, referred to on screen as Emil Blonsky. He made his first appearance in the comic story ""The Abomination!"" from Tales to Astonish #90 by writer Stan Lee and artist Gil Kane.

General Thaddeus E. ""Thunderbolt"" Ross, referred to as General Thunderbolt Ross on screen. He made his first appearance in the comic story ""The Hulk"" from The Incredible Hulk #1 (May 1962) by writer Stan Lee and artist Jack Kirby.

Samuel Sterns/The Leader, referred to as Dr. Samuel Sterns on screen. He made his first appearance in the comic story ""Enter... the Chameleon!"" from Tales to Astonish #62 (December 1964) by writer Stan Lee and artist Steve Ditko.

Dr. Leonard Samson, aka Leonard Skivorski Jr./Doc Samson. He made his first appearance in the comic story ""His Name is... Samson!"" from The Incredible Hulk #141 (July 1971) by writer Roy Thomas and artist Herb Trimpe.

James 'Jim' Wilson, who made his first appearance in the comic story ""A Titan Stalks the Tenements!"" from Incredible Hulk #131 (September 1970) by writer Roy Thomas and artist Herb Trimpe.

and a cameo appearance from Anthony Edward ""Tony"" Stark, referred to as Tony Stark on screen. He made his first appearance in the comic story ""Iron Man Is Born!"" Tales of Suspense #39 (March 1963) by writers Stan Lee & Larry Lieber and artists Don Heck & Jack Kirby.",The Incredible Hulk (2008)
Is this movie based on a book?,The Incredible Hulk is based on a fictional character created by American comic book artists and writers Stan Lee and Jack Kirby for a Marvel Comics comic book series of the same name. The Incredible Hulk #1 first appeared in May 1962.,The Incredible Hulk (2008)
Is this a sequel?,"Yes and no. Depending on how you look at it, this can be a ""reboot"" of the Hulk movie franchise, much like Batman Begins (2005) was to the Batman film franchise. However, there are references to the previous film. For example, The Incredible Hulk begins in Brazil, which is where Hulk (2003) leaves off. This is because the script that was used for The Incredible Hulk was originally supposed to be a sequel, until Marvel decided against it, and Edward Norton reworked the script to firmly establish it as a ""reboot"". So basically, it is a sequel in that it continues from where Hulk ended. The flashback to the character's origin is slightly different to what happened in Hulk, meaning retroactive continuity. The reason for the ""reboot"" hoopla seems to stem from Norton's inability to take over another actor's role without it being considered sloppy seconds or the studio's wanting to separate itself from the wrongly criticized 2003 film, thus the idea that it's the first of a series instead of a sequel. We could also look at the ""new origin"" as Banner actually returning after the main events of the first film so that Betty and he could try to get rid of ""it"", unwittingly unleashing it again, hurting Betty, with General Ross pissed more than ever after giving him another chance.",The Incredible Hulk (2008)
Why didn't Edward Norton receive credit for the screenplay?,"While the filmmakers and cast felt that the contributions Edward Norton made to the screenplay were significant, the WGA felt differently and gave sole credit to Zak Penn. The WGA tends to favor plot and structure, rather than dialogue and character changes, much to many screenwriters' chagrin. It's also possible that Norton requested not to be credited, as he has done uncredited rewrites on quite a few of his films, most notably American History X (1998).",The Incredible Hulk (2008)
"Does this film take place before or after the events of ""Iron Man 2""?",The opening montage of The Incredible Hulk takes place prior to the events of Iron Man 2 (2010). The latter half of Iron Man 2 runs concurrent to the first half of The Incredible Hulk as the news report for the aftermath of the Hulk's battle on the university campus is on the news near the end of Iron Man 2. The final scene of The Incredible Hulk takes place after the events of Iron Man 2 as Tony Stark is just joining the Avengers by the end of the second Iron Man film.,The Incredible Hulk (2008)
What superheroes/villains are alluded to or make appearances in this fim?,"The obvious. Bruce Banner / The Hulk (main character) and Emil Blonsky / The Abomination (main Villain).

The not-so-obvious. Tony Stark makes a cameo appearance at the end of the film to talk to General Ross about the ""Avenger Initiative."" Stark Industries products are all over this film as well. Nick Fury's name appears briefly during the opening credits on a government document, hinting that, like in the comic books, he is behind the Hulk task force.

Sequel hints. Samuel Sterns / The Leader tries to help Banner cure his condition. Sterns' transformation into the Leader begins to happen when Banner's blood drips into an open cut on Stern's forehead. His head begins to pulse and grow, setting up a sequel with The Leader as the superintelligent supervillain.

General 'Thunderbolt' Ross also becomes the Red Hulk in the Marvel Comics; however there are no hints in this movie that he will become Red Hulk, but Ross is still in this movie.

Allusions. (1) Captain America when Ross talks to Blonsky about the super-soldier serum that was tested in WWII and was put on ice. There is a scene that didn't make the cut where Banner goes to Antarctica to kill himself. When he attempts to shoot himself, he becomes the Hulk and smashes an iceberg-the same iceberg which is supposed to contain Captain America. (2) Doc Samson: The psychiatrist whom Banner talks to about his ""problem"" (i.e., the Hulk transformations). In the comics, Dr. Samson is a long-time supporting character and becomes a superhero in his own right when he attempts to cure Banner by draining out the gamma radiation that turns Bruce into the Hulk and bombards himself with it.",The Incredible Hulk (2008)
Why does Robert Downey Jr. appear in the cast list as Tony Stark?,"He has a cameo. He tells General Ross that they are assembling a team, which we all know to be the Avengers. He knows about it because in Iron Man, Nick Fury visits him at the end. These links turned out to be part of a trend in the certain Marvel movies published from 2008 onward. Marvel Studios gained the rights back to Iron Man, Hulk, Captain America, Thor and Ant-Man. These characters, along with Wasp, were the classic line-up of the Avengers. Marvel Studios' plan was and is to make the individual movies (which reference each other and establish that these characters all live in the same world), then cross them over into a multi-superhero epic (The Avengers (2012)), and has already done so for the classic members of the Avengers.",The Incredible Hulk (2008)
Did Stark appear to recruit Banner for the Avengers or offer General Ross assistance in capturing Banner?,"In the end of the Captain America: The First Avenger (2011), it shows that Nick Fury, director of SHIELD, already started the Avengers initiative, and the Hulk had already been recruited. In Marvel One-Shot: The Consultant, it is shown that Stark was sent by Agent Coulson of SHIELD to retrieve the Abomination from Ross for the Avengers. But, unbeknownst to both Stark and Ross, the real reason Stark was sent was because Coulson knew that Stark would irritate Ross so much that there would be no chance that Ross would give them Blonsky.",The Incredible Hulk (2008)
Is the Hulk shorter than he was in the first movie?,"Yes. In Hulk, he was 15 to 25 feet tall, becoming taller the more angry he became. In The Incredible Hulk, he will not grow over nine feet tall, which is closer to his comic book counterpart's height of seven feet. Read more here.",The Incredible Hulk (2008)
What scenes never made the theatrical cut?,"A whole subplot with Betty and Leonard, implying that they live together, his implication on the attack on the Hulk in the Campus, his relationship with Betty and his feelings towards Bruce Banner.

Blonsky describes the Hulk to General Greller: ""eight foot, fifteen hundred pounds easy... and green. Or grey, sir. Greenish grey.. It was very dark, I couldn't tell.""

General Greller gets angry about General Ross's ""bioforce project"".

Banner walks along a snowy hillside where he is going to attempt suicide.

Banner delivers pizza.",The Incredible Hulk (2008)
Will the 135-minute cut be released on Blu-Ray/DVD?,"Louis Leterrier said, ""all of the footage will be on the DVD"", so most likely there will not be a director's cut.",The Incredible Hulk (2008)
Will there be a sequel?,"Unfortunately, likely not any time soon. Kevin Fiege has gone on record in saying that Universal Studios (that own the rights to solo Hulk films) don't play well with others. Which likely means they have no desire to collaborate with Marvel Studios to create a sequel. So Hulk's story arcs are part of the ensemble films such as Avengers and Thor Ragnarok.",The Incredible Hulk (2008)
Are there any scenes after the credits?,"No, but there is one scene prior to the end credits that actually was meant to play after the credits. Tony Stark finds General Ross in a bar and asks for his help about a ""special team [they are] putting together"".",The Incredible Hulk (2008)
Is this in the same universe as the rest of the Marvel movies?,"Only some of them. All cinematic material made under the Marvel Studios banner, e.g., Iron Man (2008), The Incredible Hulk (2008), Thor (2011) and Captain America: The First Avenger (2011) (2011), are all set in the same universe (known as the Marvel Cinematic Universe), with the characters crossing over (most notably SHIELD personnel - Fury, Coulson, Romanoff or Barton), culminating in The Avengers (2012) which ties these films together. Marvel Studios also owns / owned The Punisher and Blade, however The Punisher (2004), Punisher: War Zone (2008), Blade (1998), Blade II (2002) and Blade: Trinity (2004) are / were not in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Other Marvel-based films owned by other studios are not set in the MCU, due to differing ownership. This includes, for example: Spider-Man (2002) and Ghost Rider (2007) (both owned by Sony); X-Men (2000), Fantastic Four (2005), and Daredevil (2003) (all owned by Fox).",The Incredible Hulk (2008)
Why was the U.S. Coast Guard left out of the Hammer Drones?,"Probably because the Army, Air Force, Marines and Navy are the chief branches of the military that are called up immediately when the United States goes to war. Hammer Industries primary function is producing weapons for war so Justin Hammer probably thought it'd be best to introduce the flashiest drones he had to wow the US government at the convention.

The Coast Guard is a division of the US Navy and, as the name suggests, is almost solely tasked with protecting America's shorelines and a few large bodies of water, like the Gulf of Mexico. They are not actually deployed to foreign regions like the other four are. However, if Hammer had been successful with rolling out his drones to the chief four branches, then it's probably very likely he'd come up with something for the Coast Guard too.",Iron Man 2 (2010)

What is 'Iron Man 2' about?,"Now that his identity as Iron Man has been made public, billionaire inventor Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is being pressured by the government, the public, and the press to share his technology with the military. Meanwhile, Russian physicist Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke), whose father was once partners with Tony's father, has recently partnered with rival weapons contractor Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell), planning to create Iron Man drones to demonstrate at the Stark Weapons Expo. On top of that, Tony discovers that his body is slowly being poisoned by the palladium in the arc reactor that keeps the shrapnel from piercing his heart. Expecting to die within the year, he appoints his former personal assistant Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) to the position of CEO of Stark Industries, replacing her with Natalie Rushman (Scarlett Johansson), who isn't all that she seems.",Iron Man 2 (2010)
Is 'Iron Man 2' based on a book?,"Iron Man 2 is the second movie in American director Jon Favreau's Iron Man series, preceded by Iron Man (2008) (2008) and followed by Iron Man Three (2013) (2013). The Iron Man character is based on a comic book of the same name created by Marvel Comics editor Stan Lee and artists Don Heck and Jack Kirby. Iron Man first appeared in issue #39 of Tales of Suspense (March 1963). The screenplay for Iron Man 2 was written by American screenwriter Justin Theroux.",Iron Man 2 (2010)
How long of an interval is there between this movie and the first one?,"The sequel takes place six months after the first one. The first scene of the film directly follows the ending of the first one, then after that scene, the film's timeline jumps forward six months.",Iron Man 2 (2010)
Which superheroes are shown or referenced in the film?,"Iron Man, of course, plus War Machine (Don Cheadle), Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), and Black Widow appear. There are references to at least three other superheros: the Hulk is referenced in a news report of the aftermath of his university battle, Captain America's shield is featured, and Thor's hammer (Mjolnir) is seen after the end credits. Finally, 7 years after the release of the film, Marvel confirmed a long-held fan theory that the boy wearing the Iron Man helmet who is saved by Tony is a young Peter Parker (Spider-Man), although they did not reveal if this was an intentional Easter Egg or a retcon.",Iron Man 2 (2010)
Isn't Nick Fury white?,"There are two versions of Nick Fury. The white Nick Fury is the original and has appeared in Marvel's comic books since 1964. This version of Nick Fury was depicted by David Hasselhoff in the 1998 TV movie, Nick Fury: Agent of Shield (1998). In 2001 Marvel released a new line of comic books called Ultimate Marvel. This was a reboot that updated and streamlined all of Marvel's classic characters. Some characters were radically changed. The Ultimate Marvel version of Nick Fury was made black and designed, with the actor's permission, to look like Samuel L. Jackson. Both classic Marvel and Ultimate Marvel comics are released side-by-side, which means both versions of Nick Fury are available in comic books today. The Ultimate version has proven popular enough that it has been used as the basis for Nick Fury in the recent Marvel movies.",Iron Man 2 (2010)
Why doesn't Natalie speak with a Russian accent?,"Because she is 100% fluent in English. As a Russian spy she would have been trained to perfect the English language to better infiltrate wherever in the U.S. she was sent. After she defected to SHIELD, she would still be speaking English and if you are fluent, you wouldn't have an accent.

This is further elaborated on in Black Widow. When she was a child, she was assigned to be part of a family of Russian spies. All of whom have American accents. Until they are back in Russia. Then they all have Russian accents.",Iron Man 2 (2010)
What was that thing that was spinning on Pepper Potts' desk in Tony's old office at Stark Industries?,"It is called the Swinging Sticks, a kinetic energy sculpture designed to keep spinning indefinitely until someone or something stops it. The sculpture is out of production but was expensive when available.",Iron Man 2 (2010)
Why does Tony Stark have Captain America's shield when Captain America was buried with it?,"Howard Stark (Tony's father) built and designed Captain America's suit and also the shield. In Captain America: The First Avenger (2011), we see that Howard Stark had made quite a few prototypes for Cap's shield and Rogers picked one, (which was the simplest design in the shop) and was the one he was frozen with. It's likely the shield that Tony has is just one of the prototypes. As we see it is incomplete and very likely not made of Vibranium, the indestructible metal alloy of the real shield. In the comics series, Stark had outfitted the shield with electronic components to enhance it's flight capabilities, i.e., to make it more accurate for Cap when he'd throw it as a weapon. However, Cap decided later to have the electronics removed because he said they decreased the shield's accuracy. The shield shown in this movie could be a version of the electronically enhanced one and is meant to be an Easter Egg of sorts.",Iron Man 2 (2010)
Does this movie address Tony's alcoholism?,"Both this film and the previous both imply that Tony likes to drink heavily. In this film, Pepper asks, ""Are you drunk?"", when Stark offers her the CEO position, and Stark also gets extremely drunk during a party later in the film and starts recklessly destroying things in his own house while wearing the Iron Man suit. This film addresses the alcoholism more directly than the first but no characters say conclusively that Tony has a drinking problem. And, as we see during the progression of the story, Tony stops drinking entirely to focus on creating his new element and stopping Justin Hammer & Vanko.",Iron Man 2 (2010)
"Pepper and Happy refer to the briefcase armor as ""the football"". What does it mean?","""The football"" is a term used by the US Secret Service to refer to the black briefcase that one agent always carries with them wherever the US President goes-it's a specialized control panel that allows access to launch codes in the event that the President has to launch a nuclear counter-strike if their country is attacked. The briefcase is also sometimes called ""the black box"". Stark's briefcase armor is housed in a similar case which, like real one, is handcuffed to Happy Hogan's wrist. For fun, the writers took a cue from the real thing.",Iron Man 2 (2010)
How does the movie end?,"After defeating Vanko's drones, Iron Man and War Machine confront Vanko, who has outfitted himself in body armor that also includes his whips. Working together, Tony and Rhodey finally take Vanko out by firing their repulsor rays at each other, causing a large explosion. As Vanko lays defeated, he smiles and says, ""You lose."" Suddenly, the arc reactors in the downed drones begin to glow red, and Rhodey realizes that they are rigged to blow. Tony quickly flies to the Expo Center to rescue Pepper, who is so stressed out that she quits the position as CEO and, for the first time, she and Tony share a kiss. Later, at a debriefing, Fury informs Tony that, due to his impulsive behavior and narcissistic personality, they no longer want him to become an Avenger but that they would like to retain him as a consultant. Tony agrees to serve as a consultant on the condition that Senator Stern (Garry Shandling) presents him and Rhodey with their medals for bravery. In a post-credits scene, SHIELD agent Coulson (Clark Gregg) is seen driving to a remote impact crater in the New Mexico desert. As he informs Fury over the phone that they've ""found it"", the crater is shown to contain Mjölnir, the hammer of Thor.",Iron Man 2 (2010)
Is this in the same universe as the rest of the Marvel movies?,"Only some of them. All cinematic material made under the Marvel Studios banner, e.g., Iron Man (2008) (2008), The Incredible Hulk (2008) (2008), Thor (2011) (2011) and (2011), are all set in the same universe (known as the Marvel Cinematic Universe), with the characters crossing over (most notably SHIELD personnel—Fury, Coulson, Romanoff or Barton), culminating in The Avengers (2012) (2012) which ties these films together.

Other Marvel-based films owned by other studios are not set in the MCU, due to differing ownership. This includes, for example: Spider-Man (2002) (2002) and Ghost Rider (2007) (2007) (both owned by Sony); X-Men (2000) (2000), Fantastic Four (2005) (2005), and Daredevil (2003) (2003) (all owned by Fox). However, due to a deal made between Marvel and Sony, Spider-man has been able to appear in the MCU since 2016, starting with a brief appearance in Captain America: Civil War (2016), and followed by a starring appearance in Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017).",Iron Man 2 (2010)
Where is Stan Lee's cameo in this movie?,Stan Lee is dressed as Larry King when Tony Stark is leaving the Stark Expo.,Iron Man 2 (2010)
Why was Terrence Howard replaced by Don Cheadle as James Rhodes?,"For a variety of reasons, Marvel chose to offer the role to Don Cheadle, and he accepted. There is no verified information as to why there was a split between Terrence Howard and Marvel, other than they wanted their original choice of Cheadle. There was a lot of speculation that Howard was replaced over contract negotiations. Already the highest paid in Iron Man, he had wanted more money for taking on a bigger role and also because the first movie had done so well. But Marvel did not want to renegotiate, and Howard was subsequently replaced. This is the version from Howard and has never been confirmed officially by Marvel.",Iron Man 2 (2010)
What scenes didn't make it to the theatrical release?,"Three scenes didn't make it to the theatrical release. (1) Natasha Romanoff tries out one of Tony Stark's repulsors, and Tony says, ""Nail it!"". (2) Natasha says, ""Is it dirty enough?"" Stark replies, ""It's getting there."" (Natasha's line remains; Stark's reply was cut.). (3) In the back of the plane, as he prepares to fly to the Stark Convention in Queens, New York, Pepper holds the Iron Man helmet. Tony says, ""Give me a smooch, I might not make it back."" Pepper responds by kissing the mouth of the Iron Man mask and saying, ""Go get 'em boss."" She throws it out of the aircraft; Tony says, ""You complete me"", and jumps out after it.",Iron Man 2 (2010)

Is 'Thor' based on a book?,"Thor is based on a character created by comic book writers, artists, and editors Stan Lee, Larry Lieber, and Jack Kirby. He debuted in the August 1962 issue of Journey Into Mystery (#83). Thor, the film, is the fourth movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and is the first to feature Thor as a starring character.

What other Marvel characters make an appearance?,"SHIELD Director Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), has a cameo in the scene after the credits, similar to his appearance in Iron Man (2008). In this scene he shows Erik the Cosmic Cube, foreshadowing events in Captain America: The First Avenger (2011), much like the scene in Iron Man 2 (2010) did for Thor. SHIELD Agent Phil Coulson, who was introduced in the Iron Man films, plays a considerably larger role in this film as the person in charge of studying Thor's hammer. Clint Barton (Jeremy Renner), a.k.a. Hawkeye, appears as one of the SHIELD agents trying to stop Thor from getting his hammer back. The big, muscular black agent who briefly fights with Thor in this scene has also been acknowledged by fans as Luke Cage (though he may not be).

What other mentions of the Marvel characters are there?,"(1) Erik tells Jane and Darcy of a fellow scientist he once knew who studied gamma rays and who came into contact by SHIELD who then went missing shortly afterwards. As this movie is a setup for The Avengers, he is like referring to Bruce Banner, the Hulk, although it could be Hank Pym or Betty Ross but neither of them are in The Avengers movie. Also, both Erik and Banner will be in The Avengers movie and so could have a ""reunion"" scene. (2) The special SHIELD agent at the crater site with the compound-bow 'n' arrow who has Thor in his sights is Clint Barton, a.k.a Hawkeye. (3) The big, strongly-built black agent who fights with Thor in the scene previously mentioned could be Luke Cage, or a reference to this character. (4) When the Destroyer first appears and is surrounded by the SHIELD agents, one SHIELD agent asks Agent Coulson, ""Is that one of Stark's?"", to which he replies, ""I dunno.

How does the movie end?,"Asking for Jane's forgiveness, Thor uses Mjolnir to destroy the Bifrost Bridge in order to close the portal between the worlds and keep Loki from destroying Jötunheim. The bridge begins to crumble, causing Thor and Loki to fall off. But Odin, having awakened from his sleep, manages to grab hold of Thor's leg, and Thor grabs onto Loki's staff. As the brothers hang there, Loki tries to assure Odin that he could have been successful, but Odin says, ""No."" Dismayed by Odin's disapproval, Loki releases his hold on the staff and allows himself to fall into the abyss. Some days later, while the castle feasts, Sif (Jaimie Alexander) asks Frigga (Rene Russo) how Thor is doing, and the Queen replies that he mourns for his brother and misses the mortal woman. Meanwhile in New Mexico, Jane, Erik, and Darcy notice that the portal's gateway has disappeared. Thor admits to his father that he has a lot to learn but hopes that someday he will make Odin proud. Odin puts his hand on Thor's shoulder and replies, ""You've already made me proud."" In the final scene, Thor and Heimdall (Idris Elba) stand on the Asgardian side of the broken bridge. Thor bemoans that Earth is lost to them, but Heimdall replies, ""No, there is always hope,"" and reveals that Jane is working in her lab and searching for him.",Thor (2011)
Is there anything after the credits?,"Following the credits is a short scene, a lead-in to The Avengers. Erik meets with SHIELD Director Nick Fury (Samuel L.

Why is the Norse god Heimdall played by an actor who doesn't pass for Nordic?,"In the Marvel Universe, Asgard is actually another dimension with extensive lands and continents reaching well beyond Valhalla. In the comics there have been Asgardians with East Asian features so the idea of one with black features isn't as outrageous, since it's only one of multiple races among humans and Asgardians. The Vikings worshiped the Asgardians as gods due to their fantastic powers, though they are not gods, simply a race of incredibly powerful beings. The character Darcy points this out in the film. The reason such characters may have been interpreted as all being Caucasian is because the Vikings may have assumed they all were, or the stories changed them to resemble Norseman as the stories passed through history.",Thor (2011)

Who is the villain?,"Johann Schmidt, the Red Skull, is the villain, played by Hugo Weaving. The Red Skull is a Nazi German officer and the head of HYDRA, the special sciences branch of the Nazi SS. In this movie, he forces Dr. Abraham Erskine to develop a Super Soldier serum in order to make him the pinnacle of human perfection. Erskine reluctantly complies, but when Schmidt takes the serum, it does not work as planned; it gives him enhanced strength like Steve Rogers but it also has side effects; his face turns a grotesque blood-red and mutates into a hairless skull. As a result, Schmidt has his current head scientist, Arnim Zola, design masks for him which look like his old face which he wears in public to hide the mutation. Erskine later explains to Steve Rogers that the Super Soldier serum enhances the core of whoever takes it; therefore, Rogers, a ""good"" man in-and-out, becomes a greater man, while Schmidt, a ""bad"" man in-and-out, becomes even more evil and hideous.",Captain America: The First Avenger (2011)
Does Stan Lee make a cameo in this movie?,"Stan Lee appears as a military dignitary at a press conference and speaks one line of dialogue. This is somewhat breaking with tradition considering Lee had nothing to do with the creation of the character, but he did come up with the concept of Captain America using his shield as a throwing weapon in a 1940s text story, wrote many of Captain America's most famous comic book story-arcs and is co-creator of The Avengers, which Captain America is a member of following the events of this film.",Captain America: The First Avenger (2011)
What superhuman abilities does Captain America possess?,"Captain America was created during World War II, using the ""Super Soldier"" serum, then being bombarded with ""Vita Rays"", an early form of radiation which activates the serum in his body. This formula effectively turned Steve Rogers into the perfect human, with abilities beyond those of the best Olympic athletes including enhanced strength, agility and reflexes. However, he does not have ""super powers"" per se; he has the best strength, agility and reflexes that any human can have without being considered superhuman, i.e., any form of supernatural influence with grants him his powers. His immune system allows him to resist most diseases as well as gives him incredible endurance. For example, his metabolism operates at a rate of four times the normal human; as a result, his muscles build up lactic acid at an extremely slow rate, allowing him to have almost limitless endurance and operate at peak performance for far longer than any conventional human being. Additionally, the Super Soldier serum has effectively been metabolized into Rogers' body; it is that enhancement that somehow allowed him to be frozen in ice in suspended animation for decades (as opposed to dying from hypothermia) until rescued by SHIELD. The film version of the treatment also gives him heightened mental acuity; he is able to accurately memorize a map of HYDRA bases after only a few seconds of looking at it during a raid.

This movie version uses more the abilities of the ""Ultimate"" universe Captain America. In which he is super strong and agile, but not to the extent of Spider-man and nowhere near Hulk or Thor. This is demonstrated in the movie when he is easily lifting a motorcycle while three women sit on it for an extended time. That should be between 800 and 900 pounds (360 and 400 kilograms). Olympic class power lifters can lift around four and a half times their body weight, with a great amount of exertion. That means a non superhuman Captain America, at peak performance could only lift around 800 pounds under optimal conditions and with a great deal of exertion. If he didn't have some superhuman ability, the movie version could never do this, unless he had some amount of super strength, even with an enhanced metabolism. Perhaps the motorcycle was just fake, made of very light material as a tool to allow the girls to sit on it, and Rogers had to lift barely more than them (which would have constituted an acceptable weight of around 350 pounds [160 kilograms]). In addition, he is able to leap over a roughly 10-foot fence (roughly 3-meter fence) while running, clearing it easily. Finally, as his metabolism expels toxic substances very quickly, he can't get drunk.

He was trained in nearly every form of unarmed combat as well as gymnastics; as a result he is considered the finest unarmed combatant in the world. He is so formidable that in a recent story when a villain temporarily neutralized Cap's physical enhancements, he took on four guards escorting him who themselves were enhanced with the same treatment and defeats them all within seconds. He also studied military history and strategy extensively, which will establish him as the ideal field leader of his superpowered fellows in the Avengers. He also has his iconic Shield, which is made of a combination of Vibranium and an unnamed metal alloy; although the alloy has been mistakenly identified as Adamantium, Dr. Myron MacClain (the scientist who designed the shield) did not discover Adamantium until years later. The shield is virtually indestructible; additionally, the Vibranium allows the shield to absorb an extreme amount of impact without transferring it through the shield, i.e. Cap gets punched by Hulk and blocks with the shield, he won't sustain any severe injury from the impact like a broken arm. He uses it as a shield, a blunt object, and throws it like a discus which can be angled to ricochet back to him after connecting with its target, or caroming off other objects before hitting its target. In later installments of The Avengers, we see him working in tandem with Thor; Thor hits the shield with his hammer, Mjolnir, causing a massive shockwave that takes down enemy soldiers.",Captain America: The First Avenger (2011)
Why doesn't Captain America have his spandex and chainmail outfit?,"The producers of the film decided to give Cap an outfit that would reflect what the army would really have given him in World War II. The colors are similar (the gloves and boots are more brownish-red than pure red) but the material makeup of the outfit is very much like what a regular soldier would wear in the combat zone, with regular boots as opposed to the pirate-like ""swashbuckler"" boots in the comic, military-style gloves instead of bright red gauntlets, etc. The outfit is not without some enhancements, however; for example, Howard Stark (the US Government's main weapons supplier) designs part of the costume using what appears to be a chain-mail / Kevlar blend with the capacity to stop bayonets from piercing it. Interestingly enough, early in the film Steve Rogers goes on a USO Tour wearing an exact copy of the comic-book outfit, albeit made out of simple cloth as opposed to chain-mail, complete with the ""swashbuckler"" boots, bright red gauntlets, etc. The final outfit used for the movie reflects the one designed for the Ultimate Captain America comic-book series.",Captain America: The First Avenger (2011)
Why does Captain America have two different shields?,"In the film, after Rogers has become Captain America, he is sent on an USO Tour to drum up support for US Bonds. He is given a costume with a flag motif (the classic costume as seen in the comics, albeit made out of cloth and not chain-mail) and a triangular shaped shield. The shield is made out of conventional metal with no enhanced properties. Later, Rogers has Howard Stark design him a new outfit and is presented with different shields designed by Stark. Rogers spies a simple round metal disc off to the side, and Stark explains that it is a one-of-a-kind prototype made out of Vibranium, a virtually indestructible lightweight metal which can absorb and disperse kinetic energy such that the wielder of the shield would feel virtually nothing. Stark reveals that the shield is made up of the only known specimen of Vibranium, making it the only one in existence. In the comics, Captain America started out with the triangular-shaped shield that was not indestructible. During World War II, he was given the disc-shaped shield made of an indestructible substance that was accidentally created in a lab. Dr. Myron MacClain was trying to create an indestructible armor out of an alloy of an alien metal and another experimental earthbound metal—the alloy is called Vibranium and was supposed to be a new type of armor for American tanks. The other metal in Cap's shield is mistakenly identified as Adamantium, the same metal with which Wolverine's claws are made and skeleton reinforced, although Dr. MacClain did not discover Adamantium until years later. Thus the shield is both indestructible and absorbs energy, meaning that with it Cap can—for example—take a punch from the Hulk and not break his arm or be sent flying. MacClain was not able to duplicate the result, so Captain America's near-indestructible disc shield is the only one in existence.",Captain America: The First Avenger (2011)
Is there a scene at the end of the credits?,"Yes: Steve Rogers is training on a heavy bag, when Nick Fury interrupts Rogers to inform him that he has a mission lined up. Fury also reminds Rogers that he's not the only hero around, which segues into a teaser trailer for The Avengers (2012).",Captain America: The First Avenger (2011)
What is the artifact that Schmidt uses to power his technology?,"It is a ""cosmic cube,"" a well-known artifact from the comics, here renamed the ""Tesseract"". Although Schmidt never realizes this, he has tapped only the tiniest fraction of the device's power. Within the Marvel Universe, a cosmic cube is the embryonic form of a Beyonder, one of a race of immensely powerful beings. Those who understand a cosmic cube's nature (which, fortunately, Schmidt never did) and are mentally strong enough can use it to rewrite reality in whatever way they wish. The Tesseract becomes even more important in the next MCU installment, The Avengers.",Captain America: The First Avenger (2011)
"Why does Captain America's shield appear in ""Iron Man 2"" if it was frozen with him?","When Captain America finally receives his shield, Howard Stark (Tony Stark's father) gives him the choice of many prototypes. In Iron Man 2 (2010), Tony Stark is seen in possession of what appears to be Captain America's shield. However, the shield in Iron Man 2 is incomplete and does not look the same as the one in Captain America: The First Avenger. Therefore the shield in Iron Man 2 may have been one of the many prototypes. Another possibility is that a considerable amount of time has passed between finding Captain America in the beginning of this film and the shield appearance in Iron Man and Iron Man 2, thus giving time to Stark to acquire the shield. Another storyline in the mythos of the character tells how Howard Stark had tried to enhance the shield or build a prototype that was fitted with electronic components allowing Rogers to control the shield while it was in flight, possibly increasing it's accuracy when thrown at a target. Rogers abandoned it later, saying that the components made the shield less accurate when he used it in this manner.",Captain America: The First Avenger (2011)
How can Captain America's shield bounce off things? Howard Stark stated it was 100% shock-absorbent.,"By implication, Howard Stark is simply incorrect. Captain America's shield, in this incarnation of the myth, is made from pure vibranium, an exotic metal whose properties are not fully understood. In the comics, it has shown many different effects, one of which is the ability to absorb energy vibrations such as sound which serve to harden the molecular structure. The more it absorbs the stronger it becomes. It is not, however, adept at absorbing mechanical energy such as the impacts of physical objects, which is reflected rather than absorbed, thus its ability to bounce off solid surfaces. When Thor struck the shield in The Avengers (2012), its hardness was strong enough that it could withstand a blow from Mjölnir and also becoming stronger due to the energy vibrations of the lightning the hammer emitted.",Captain America: The First Avenger (2011)
Is Schmidt dead?,"No. The Tesseract converted him to energy and teleported him into the rift it had opened. He does not appear in the sequel, Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014). Furthermore, Hugo Weaving said that he is not interested in returning as Schmidt. Avengers Infinity War and Endgame brought the character back seven years later, now played by Ross Marquand and deified as a 'Grim Reaper' who protects the Soul Gem on planet Vormir.",Captain America: The First Avenger (2011)
A waitress appears several times towards the end and even has lines where she says she would thank Captain America for saving her life. Who is she?,"Actress Ashley Johnson played Beth, a waitress who served Steve Rogers in a deleted scene at the beginning of the film.",The Avengers (2012)
"What is ""The Avengers"" about?","When the tesseract, a key to unlimited sustainable energy, is stolen by Loki (Tom Hiddleston), who intends to use it to enslave humanity and cause a global catastrophe; Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), the director of SHIELD (Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division), calls upon superheroes Steve Rogers/Captain America (Chris Evans), Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Bruce Banner/Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), and Clint Barton/Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) to stop him, who are soon joined by Loki's brother, Thor (Chris Hemsworth).",The Avengers (2012)
"Is ""The Avengers"" based on a book?","The Avengers is based on a comic book superhero team created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby. The screenplay was written by American snowrunner and filmmaker Joss Whedon (who also directed the film) and screenwriter Zak Pen. It follows the events of the films Iron Man (2008) (2008), The Incredible Hulk (2008) (2008), Iron Man 2 (2010) (2010), Thor (2011) (2011), and Captain America: The First Avenger (2011) (2011), and shares the same fictional universe as those films.",The Avengers (2012)
Who are the villains?,"The main villain is Loki. This follows the original comics where Iron Man, Thor, Hulk, Ant-Man, and Wasp form the Avengers to defeat him. Loki allies with the Chitauri, the Ultimate universe version of the Skrull. The Chitauri are the reason the team, renamed the Ultimates, formed in the Ultimate Marvel comic line. The Skrulls were unavailable to Marvel due to the rights being owned by 20th Century Fox as part of the Fantastic Four characters (including Silver Surfer and Galactus). The Other (Alexis Denisof) is either the leader of the Chitauri. This is an original character, though Herr Kleiser (of the Ultimate universe) would be a close approximation. The giant flying ""snake"" Chitauri is also original. It has been suggested that they are based on the Midgard Serpent. During the end credits, it is shown that Loki and the Chitauri were in league with Thanos (Damion Poitier). In the comics, he is in love with the embodiment of Death. He is perhaps most famous for using the Infinity Gauntlet (seen in Odin's vault in Thor) to erase half the people in the universe. He makes an appearance in Guardians of the Galaxy (2014) (2014) and is the main villain in Avengers: Infinity War (2018) (2018) and Avengers: Endgame (2019) (2019).",The Avengers (2012)
Is this in the same universe as the rest of the Marvel Studios movies?,"Yes. From 2012 onward, all Marvel Studios movies are part of the same universe, one of the many parallel universes in the Marvel multiverse. The product line is known as the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) and, from an in-multiverse context, it deals with the universe containing Earth-199999. This continuity begins with Iron Man and continues with every future Marvel movie except for those—that have already been made and owned by other studios—such as the Spider-Man trilogy (Spider-Man (2002) (2002), Spider-Man 2 (2004) (2004), and Spider-Man 3 (2007) (2007)) (whose movie rights belonged to Columbia Pictures before Sony before Marvel Studios), Daredevil (2003) (2003), Elektra (2005) (2005), the X-Men films and the Fantastic Four duology (whose movie rights belong to 20th Century Fox), Hulk (2003) (2003) (whose movie rights belonged to Universal Pictures), and a few others that have come out coinciding with the release of Marvel Studios' culminating product line. The movie rights to Iron Man, The Avengers, Thor, Nick Fury, Captain America and others all belong to Marvel Studios. Because of this, continuity is more easily achieved. When a deal with Paramount Pictures was made in 2007, Paramount released the Marvel Studios films Iron Man and The Incredible Hulk in 2008, plus Iron Man 2 in 2010, and Thor and Captain America both in 2011. Because of Walt Disney Studios' acquisition of Marvel in 2010, the Walt Disney Pictures label has further released the Marvel Studios films The Avengers and took over worldwide distribution for the MCU's Phase Two: Iron Man 3 and Thor: The Dark World both in 2013, Captain America: The Winter Soldier and Guardians of the Galaxy both in 2014, Avengers: Age of Ultron and Ant-Man both in 2015. Since studio deals are subject to change, it is suggested to keep an eye on Marvel.com or showbiz sites like HollywoodReporter.com for all the latest news.",The Avengers (2012)
How did Thor return?,"While not spelled out, Loki rhetorically asks how much Dark Energy the All Father (Odin) used to send Thor to Earth, implying the ""other ways"" Loki briefly mentioned to Heimdall in the first film depicting both characters, as well as establishing Thor's coming to Earth as a costly move for Odin. Loki also mentions that Thor would need the Tesseract to return, implying that the Tesseract itself is going to be the energy source for both Asgardians to go home.",The Avengers (2012)
Why does Banner become a team player the second time he turns into Hulk?,"It appears as if for Hulk's first featured transformation, Loki was in some way influencing things. Romanoff says as much when inviting Banner to remove himself from the situation. There is also a somewhat dreamlike nature to the scene, with Thor's ""petty humans"" line, Stark rubbing his temples (as Banner did when he sees Loki arrive on the boat), without realizing it Banner picks up Loki's staff and so on (suggesting something unnatural going on) plus the strange camera movements and framing. With the second transformation, Banner was free from such interference. Arguments can also be made that (1) the first transformation was under stress after a fall during an attack whereas the second was a free choice; (2) the conversations with Stark about letting loose and realizing the Hulk absorbing the gamma radiation saved Banner, coupled with security guard's comment that the Hulk aimed for the abandoned factory, allowed Banner to realize that if he embraced the Hulk he could work with him. This is consistent with the character(s) of Bruce Banner and the Hulk; when provoked unexpectedly, the Hulk destroys in a blind rage, but when called upon by Banner's righteous anger, he can maintain a primitive understanding of friend and enemy; (3) that he was actually in control in the first instance, but he was angry with SHIELD and specifically Romanoff, for putting him in that situation and they were feeling his rage (perhaps still in part due to Loki's influence). He isn't on some out of control rampage, he stalks Romanoff, and then his attention is turned to Thor and the pilot.

Much of Banner's character revelation comes through subtext in his interactions with Tony Stark. Stark realises early that Banner is in control (and tests this theory by pricking him with something sharp that zaps him with a small electrical charge). All other characters in the film see Banner as an unstable element (including Romanoff, who brings a SWAT team with her to collect him), but Stark, knowing Banner's secret, treats and respects him as a peer. Later in Manhattan, Stark asks if Banner has arrived yet, but none of the team know what he's talking about, having already written Banner off. The simple answer to this question, then, is in the transformations seen in the film. The first time, Banner is shown to try to prevent the transformation. He is at odds with Hulk, not wanting to do harm to the people on the base. He is internally conflicted and loses control. The second time, as predicted by Stark, he brings Hulk to the battle with intent and thus is balanced and in control. When Iron Man is falling out from the portal, the audience is led to believe that Thor is going to rescue him, but it's the Hulk who jumps in to save his friend. Right before he enters his final battle in The Incredible Hulk (2008) (2008), Bruce says to General Ross and Betty that he can't control it but maybe he can ""aim it."" The last scene of the movie ends with him in a cabin in the woods meditating. In meditation, he opens his eyes and they are Hulk green as the ""Incident Counter"" drops to from 31 days to 0. This is followed by a simple grin and a cut to the Avengers cut scene.",The Avengers (2012)
"What does Black Widow mean by ""Red on [her] ledger""?","While the term ""gushing red"" that Loki uses to taunt her evokes an image of shed blood, essentially what is meant is that she has done a lot of bad things in the past and hasn't yet done enough good to balance out the bad. The term actually derives from finance ledgers, where debts were denoted in red ink and profits in black ink. She owes a debt, on a karmic level.",The Avengers (2012)
"How did the Tesseract get from Asgard (at the beginning of ""Thor"") to Norway (at the beginning of ""Captain America"")?","The Tesseract does not feature in Thor (until the post credit scene where Nick Fury shows it to Erik Selvig). It is not the same thing that the Frost Giants used (that was the Casket of Ancient Winters) in Thor. The Tesseract was sent to Earth for safe keeping/lost on Earth and left there for everyone's best interests long ago, and is being guarded at the start of Captain America: The First Avenger, until Red Skull steals it for his own ends. At the end of The First Avenger, Howard Stark retrieves it from the ocean when he found it while looking for Captain America's crashed plane, and it has been in S.H.I.E.L.D.'s possession ever since.",The Avengers (2012)
Why didn't Edward Norton play Bruce Banner/The Incredible Hulk in this film?,"Negotiations between Norton and Marvel eventually broke down, and the role was instead offered to Mark Ruffalo, who accepted. Norton wrote a public response to the decision on his Facebook page, stating that he will not be appearing in The Avengers, but thanked Marvel Studios for considering letting him reprise the role.",The Avengers (2012)
Where is Stan Lee's cameo in this movie?,"Near the very end of the movie, there is a montage of news reports and television clips with people talking about the Avengers. Stan Lee says to the camera, ""Superheroes in New York?...Gimme a break!"" There is also a deleted scene in which Steve Rogers has a conversation with a server at an outdoor cafe in New York City, after which Stan Lee turns to him from a nearby table and says, ""Ask for her number, moron.""",The Avengers (2012)
How much screen time does each Avenger get?,"According to the Vulture blog, it breaks down as follows: (1) Hawkeye, 12 minutes, 44 seconds; (2) Thor, 25 minutes, 52 seconds; (3) Bruce Banner & the Hulk, 28 minutes, 3 seconds; (4) Black Widow, 33 minutes, 35 seconds; (5) Iron Man, 37 minutes, 1 second; and (6) Captain America, 37 minutes, 42 seconds. Although, the article is titled ""How Much Screen Time Does Each Hero Get?"", it only overs the actual members of the Avengers team (prominent superheroes); i.e. missing are the screen times for Nick Fury, Phil Coulson and Maria Hill, which are considerably shorter than the main heroes'.",The Avengers (2012)
What does Black Widow wear on her wrist?,"From the Marvel Universe Wiki entry on Black Widow: Black Widow customarily wears two bracelets equipped to discharge the ""widow's bite,"" high-frequency electrostatic bolts of up to 30,000 volts, capable of stunning even a superhuman opponent at a range of at least 20 feet, shoot tear gas cartridges and act as a radio transmitter. The bracelets various functions are activated by galvanic sensors keyed to Black Widow's wrist musculature. At times she carries plastic explosive discs equivalent to 4 pounds of TNT in her belt and uses automatic weapons and/or combat knives as necessary. There is a scene showing Black Widow powering her bracelets up and during a fight towards the end of the movie the bracelets can be seen (and heard) shocking an enemy.",The Avengers (2012)
What happened to Agent Coulson?,"Agent Coulson is killed by Loki midway through the film. Clark Gregg, the actor who plays Coulson, had said that Coulson's death was an essential part of the story and that he would miss playing the character but was satisfied with the way his story ended. However, Coulson is alive in the TV series Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. (2013–) as he was brought back to life using experimental medical technology on the orders of Nick Fury. As Gregg has reprized his role as Coulson, his statement to the media was perhaps (magician-like) misdirection on his or the studio's part. The nature of Coulson's resurrection turns out to be somewhat sketchy, though: His resurrected incarnation may not really be himself. Regardless, it's possible that Gregg will appear as Coulson on the silver screen again, much later.",The Avengers (2012)
Is there an 'Avengers 2'?,"Yes. It's Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015) (2015). Marvel had announced that, with the success of The Avengers (2012), they would be producing a sequel. Age of Ultron follows the Phase Two movies Iron Man Three (2013) (2013), Thor: The Dark World (2013) (2013), Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014) (2014) and Guardians of the Galaxy (2014) (2015). (Note: Ant-Man (2015) (2015) is also in Phase Two, but was released after Age of Ultron, in addition to having no forereferences in prior Marvel Cinematic Universe movies.) Director Joss Whedon had said he would like to make the next one smaller, more personal, and painful, and he did. Age of Ultron was released on May 1st, 2015, and had the second-largest weekend opening at the box office, placing it just behind its predecessor The Avengers.",The Avengers (2012)
What is Tony Stark talking about when he references a shawarma place toward the end of the movie?,"Shawarma is a popular Levantine Arab meat preparation, where lamb, goat, chicken, turkey, beef, or mixed meats are placed on a spit (commonly a vertical spit in restaurants), and may be grilled for as long as a day. Shavings are cut off the block of meat for serving, and the remainder of the block of meat is kept heated on the rotating spit. Although it can be served in shavings on a plate (generally with accompaniments), ""shawarma"" also refers to a pita bread sandwich or wrap made with shawarma meat. Shawarma is eaten with tabbouleh, fattoush, taboon bread, tomato, and cucumber. Toppings include tahini, hummus, pickled turnips and amba. Shawarma is a fast-food staple across the Middle East, Europe and the Caucasus. A post-title scene at the very end of the closing credits shows the team in the shawarma restaurant, presumably after the final battle, looking collectively exhausted and eating. A large sign in the background declares the restaurant has the ""best shawarma in the city"". During the battle with the Chitauri, there's a very quick shot of a shawarma restaurant in the background. It's likely the same one that Stark refers to when everyone's standing over him after the battle.",The Avengers (2012)
"Throughout the movie, the Avengers communicate with each other, even the ones not wearing helmets. How?","Since only Iron Man, Black Widow, Captain America and Hawkeye communicate with each other, they're probably wearing ear devices provided by SHIELD. In fact Captain America's suit was designed by Coulson and may have had a built in transmitter in the head gear. We also know that Tony Stark can communicate with anyone from his hacking into the Quinjet's P.A. system at Stuttgart. As the Marvel Universe Wiki entry on Black Widow explains, her wrist bands are also radio transmitters, and in the books, she wears a hidden ear piece when she is on assignment so she can communicate with SHIELD. Hawkeye is the only one that cannot be explained but as a shield agent he may also have a special ear device. In the Marvel universe, he was once 80% deaf due to an injury, but his hearing was restored. So it's safe to say that his hearing aid would be a SHIELD device. It's also not uncommon, at least in movies, that earpieces are incredibly tiny, fitting inside the ear, making them very hard to see.",The Avengers (2012)
How did S.H.I.E.L.D. get the heroes' footage (which consists of scenes from the other Marvel movies)?,"According to the comics, SHIELD has cameras everywhere. It's not unreasonable to think SHIELD got hold of the footage the army shot of Captain America during World War II, as it would have been archived and used to show the public how the war was going and perhaps also used as a recruitment film. Seeing how many of the other heroes' footage was on the news, it's not hard to think SHIELD got a copy easily. As Agent Coulson stated, if it's connected to a satellite, SHIELD has access.",The Avengers (2012)
Why didn't anyone use the weapon Agent Coulson used on Loki?,"Nick Fury stated that the phase 2 weapons were not ready and were still in development. Since they were in development, it is unlikely that anyone would be trained to use them, and even Agent Coulson said he didn't know what it would do. Fury might have thought they were too dangerous for the team to use and could endanger them as much as they would Loki and the Chitauri armada. Coulson decided to take a chance and used it against Loki. Also, none of the heroes other than Thor saw Coulson use the gun, so it's likely they either didn't know what it could do, or simply didn't know it existed at all while the thunder god prefers to use Mjölnir—his war hammer—anyway.",The Avengers (2012)
"Are any ""Whedon alumni"" from his TV shows in this movie?","Yes. Jeremy Renner who plays Hawkeye was the vampire Penn in the Angel episode ""Somnambulist"" (2000). Alexis Denisof who plays The Other was Wesley Wyndam-Price in Buffy the Vampire Slayer (1997) (1997-2003) and Angel (1999) (1999-2004), and was Senator Perrin in Dollhouse (2009) (2009-2010). Enver Gjokaj who plays the young NYPD officer talking to his superior officer during the Chitauri invasion was Victor in Dollhouse. Ashley Johnson who plays Beth, the waitress at the invasion site (and interviewed thereafter), was also in Dollhouse as Wendy (briefly imprinted with Caroline) in the episode ""Omega"" (2009), and as Hayden Leeds in the unaired pilot ""Echo"" (2009).",The Avengers (2012)
What is the gap of time between this film and the other Marvel Cinematic Universe films?,"In this movie, Agent Coulson tells Thor that everything has changed since his fight in New Mexico with the Destroyer over a year ago. As the events of Thor (2011) and The Incredible Hulk (2008) take place at roughly the same time during the second half of Iron Man 2 (2010), this means they are the last films in the chronological timeline, so over a year has passed since those movies, showing how Stark Tower (substituting for the real-life MetLife Building) was built. It also means that future films could take place within this gap of time. Captain America's awakening is more recent, meaning that the opening and closing of Captain America: The First Avenger (2011) takes place shortly before The Avengers.",The Avengers (2012)
How does Bruce Banner know where the Chitauri invasion is taking place?,"During the Chitauri invasion, Bruce Banner reunites with the rest of the Avengers to take the fight to Loki. This is because he had found the Tesseract's location on his computer just before Hawkeye's assault on the Helicarrier, but the attack began before Banner could reveal his findings.",The Avengers (2012)
How come the Hulk couldn't lift Thor's hammer?,"In Thor, Odin says that Thor's hammer (called Mjolnir) was ""forged in the heart of a dying star."" This could refer to neutronium, a theoretical substance created when giant stars collapse and their gravity becomes so great that atoms are crushed; electrons combine with protons forming a substance made entirely of neutrons with a density of tons per cubic centimeter. (Imagine all the matter in the solar system being crushed into a space smaller than Earth.) Even Thor couldn't lift such mass, but Odin also says that ""whosoever is worthy"" could wield Thor's power, probably meaning that Mjolnir is enchanted, its use limited to people of either Odin's or Mjolnir's choosing. Thor threw it knowing that it would temporarily distract the Hulk who would be momentarily surprised at not being able to lift the hammer. Alternatively, if the Marvel Cinematic Universe follows all other iterations of Mjolnir, the inability to lift Mjolnir comes from Odin's enchantment and not the material, which is known as Uru, a naturally(ish) occurring metal similar in durability to Proto-Adamantium (known as Vibranium in the movies), the material in Captain America's shield. Furthermore, Mjolnir would have to be enchanted as it stands to reason, since the explanation that Thor's hammer bears a mass of hundreds of tons would imply that a number of earthly objects including floors, tables, counters, shelves et al. wouldn't be able to support its weight and its pressure effect. So, perhaps it is more of an unmovable object*, but not an unstoppable force, that maybe somehow also lacks the ability to hover midair and definitely somehow can be drawn downward by earth's gravity until at rest. [*like the titular character of Hancock (2008) (2008)]",The Avengers (2012)
Why did Loki stay around to watch Thor and Iron Man fighting ?,"His plan was to manipulate the Avengers into fighting with each other long enough for Hawkeye (and Hulk) to take out the Helicarrier, which would cripple S.H.I.E.L.D.'s ability to stop the Chitauri. Also, had it worked, the Avengers likely would've died with the Helicarrier, removing them as well. The only way he could successfully do so was to continue manipulating them while on the ship. If he had run, it would only unite them against him, and leave them off the Helicarrier when it crashed. As Nick Fury says about Loki, ""Why do I get the feeling he's the only one of us who wants to be here?""",The Avengers (2012)
How did Loki get captured?,"Loki fought Captain America in Stuttgart, Germany. Once Black Widow and Iron Man showed up, Loki surrendered relatively easy. The suspicions of both Tony Stark and Steve Rogers are raised, then Thor gets inside the transport and pulls Loki out. Thor, Captain America all get into a fight and Loki simply observes them. They then escort Loki to the Helicarrier which was part of Loki's plan all along. He wanted to manipulate the Avengers and wait for the assault from his own men. Then he would escape and hopefully the Avengers would be dead or at odds with one another.",The Avengers (2012)
Who is the Other talking to in the credits?,"The figure he is addressing is Thanos the Mad Titan. He is a major supervillain in the Marvel Universe who is a worshiper of Death. More precisely, he is literally in love with the female personification of Death and will do anything to earn her favor, such as causing the death of millions. Most likely, that is why he is smiling right after the Other notes that opposing Humanity is ""to court with death;"" he sees it as a welcome challenge to attract Death's favor.",The Avengers (2012)
Is it true that some home video releases have been altered in the Coulson-Loki scene?,"Several home video releases in Germany, the UK and other countries feature an altered version of the movie that show a tamed down version of Coulson's death, i.e. one can't see Loki's staff spearing Coulson's upper part of the body. Marvel Entertainment took a stand on it and explained two different versions were made and countries like Germany, Austria and Switzerland got the edited version. This version has also been used for home theaters without further alterations. It is highly possible that other countries are affected, too. The Italian Blu-ray release for example feature the spearing.",The Avengers (2012)
"What is the chronology for the lead-up films to the ""Avengers"" films?","Although the order of released was (1) Iron Man (2008), (2) The Incredible Hulk (2008), (3) Iron Man 2 (2010), (4) Thor (2011), and (5) Captain America: The First Avenger (2011), this is not the order in which the events of the movies occur. A rough chronological order for the films can be determined from the contents of each film:

1. Captain America: The First Avenger (2011) (2011). With the exception of the films' two bookend scenes that take place in the modern day, the rest of the film takes place in the 1940s during World War II and is therefore the first film in the series, chronologically speaking. During the final scene set in the modern day, Nick Fury explains to Captain America that he has been asleep ""for almost 70 years"". It could therefore be assumed that this scene takes place at the same time as the movie's release (2011) which would be about 70 years after Captain America was frozen in 1944.

2. Marvel One-Shot: Agent Carter (2013) (2013). Spun-off from Captain America: The First Avenger, features Peggy Carter, Howard Stark, and Dum Dum Dugan from the film. Featured on the Iron Man 3 home video release.

3. Agent Carter (2015) (2015-2016). The series takes place in 1946, four years after the events of Captain America: The First Avenger, and features characters Peggy Carter, and Howard Stark.

4. Iron Man (2008) (2008). The movie features scenes during the War in Afghanistan (2001 to present) and so can probably be assumed to take place in the present day of the movie's release (i.e. 2008). A prototype for Captain America's shield is briefly shown. The post-credits sequence also introduces Nick Fury first proposing ""The Avengers Initiative"" to Tony Stark.

5. Iron Man 2 (2010) (2010). This movie follows shortly after Iron Man and again features Nick Fury trying to convince Tony Stark to join the Avengers Initiative as a more prominent subplot this time around. A rather different prototype of Captain America's shield makes a brief cameo in this movie, probably as just an item that used to belong to Howard Stark (established to be the creator of the original shield in Captain America: The First Avenger) and later inherited by his son Tony.

6. Marvel One-Shot: A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to Thor's Hammer (2011) (2011) bridges the gap between Agent's Coulson's departure in Iron Man 2 and his arrival in Thor, showing a short scene featuring Agent Coulson stopping at a gas station on the way to New Mexico and foiling an armed robbery in the process. This short film was included among the special features of the Captain America: The First Avenger DVD.

7. Thor (2011) (2011). The post-credits sequence from Iron Man 2 features a scene taken directly from Thor in which Agent Coulson finds Thor's hammer in the New Mexico desert. Agent Coulson previously departs from Tony Stark's house for New Mexico midway through Iron Man 2, which would place the events of Thor roughly concurrent with Iron Man 2. S.H.I.E.L.D. agents even make comments about the resemblance (or lack thereof) between the Destroyer and Stark's armors, given the events involving Ivan Vanko's unmanned prototypes.

8. The Incredible Hulk (2008) (2008). A subtle background reference in Iron Man 2 (showing the aftermath of the university sequence) suggests that as with Thor the film runs slightly concurrent with the events of Iron Man 2. The soundwave weapons used by General Ross to stop Hulk in the university campus are branded ""Stark Industries"", and this very scene is watched by Tony Stark in Iron Man 2 as part of a news capsule. The film then ends some time after, backed up by the final scene which shows Tony Stark, now as a recruiting member of the Avengers Initiative, offering their services to General Ross in his pursuit of the Hulk. Though this film features possibly the fewest of Avengers references in terms of S.H.I.E.L.D. presence, the use of Captain America's super-soldier serum is alluded to in the creation of the Abomination. In a deleted/alternative opening there was an additional reference not used: Captain America's frozen body and shield are shown buried in ice after Banner causes an avalanche in the Arctic while trying to commit suicide but instead reflexively turning into the Hulk. As this is a deleted scene, and Captain America is found inside Red Skull's plane, this should not be considered canon.

9. Marvel One-Shot: The Consultant (2011) (2012) (included on the Thor DVD) bridges the gap between the end of Iron Man 2, where Tony Stark is recruited as a ""Consultant"" for the Avenger's Initiative, and the end of The Incredible Hulk where Tony Stark is seen approaching General Ross in a bar. The short suggests that Agent Coulson was under pressure to add Emil Blonsky (aka the Abomination) to the roster for the Avengers Initiative, and so sent Tony Stark in his place to speak with General Ross, knowing full well that Stark would annoy the General to such an extent that he would be certain to refuse the request.

10. The Avengers (2012) (2012). Some loose details in the previous films have been addressed. Continuity points are expected to be developed in further films.

11. Marvel One-Shot: Item 47 (2012) (2012) (included on The Avengers DVD) takes place shortly after the events depicted in The Avengers. Following the Battle of New York, regular couple Claire Wise and Benjamin Pollack discover a Chitauri weapon and use it to rob banks, and are subsequently hunted by S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Jasper Sitwell.

12. Iron Man Three (2013) (2013) takes place an unspecified amount of time after the events depicted in The Avengers and before the first episode of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.

13. Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. (2013) (2013–) takes place after Iron Man 3, based on the references to Extremis throughout the first season. The first season spans a period of time that includes the events of Thor: The Dark World and Captain America: The Winter Soldier, both of which are referenced in episodes of the show.

14. Thor: The Dark World (2013) (2013) takes place during the first season of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., shortly before The Well (2013) (2013, episode 1.08). That episode opens with the team in Greenwich, digging through the aftermath of the film's climactic sequence.

15. Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014) (2014) takes place during the first season of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., concurrent with the events of End of the Beginning (2014) (2014, episode 1.16) and Turn, Turn, Turn (2014) (2014, episode 1.17). These two episodes are built around the film's major reveal that S.H.I.E.L.D. has been infiltrated by Hydra since the organization's founding shortly after the events of Captain America: The First Avenger.

16. Guardians of the Galaxy (2014) (2014) takes place at an uncertain point in the chronology. The mid-credits scene in Thor: The Dark World most likely takes place prior to Guardians of the Galaxy, since the Collector's archive appears to be the same in both films and was heavily damaged during the latter film. The prologue takes place in 1988, and the main part of the film is identified to happen 26 years later, which would set it roughly concurrent to its real-world release in 2014. It is probable that all modern-day stories in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) without specific date references are intended to take place roughly concurrently with their dates of release (except for The Incredible Hulk, which is conclusively placed after Iron Man 2), which would make the most likely placement of Guardians of the Galaxy between seasons one and two of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. In the absence of other connecting references, however, this placement in the chronology is just speculative at this point. (The appearance of Thanos in both The Avengers and Guardians of the Galaxy does not provide any clues to their chronological relation, as no events from the former film are referenced in the latter.)

17. Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015) (2015) will take place after the events depicted in Iron Man 3, Thor: The Dark World and Captain America: The Winter Soldier. Given the apparent concurrency of MCU time and real-world time, it is likely that it will take place sometime during the last few episodes of the second season of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.

18. Ant-Man (2015) (2015) mainly takes place some time after Avengers: Age of Ultron as there's reference to the Avengers being ""too busy dropping cities out of the sky"", an event that happened in ""Age of Ultron"".

The announced Hulk TV series (written and produced by Guillermo del Toro) is not going to take place in this same fictional universe.",The Avengers (2012)
Do all Joss Whedon creations take place in the same reality?,"It's possible, since Buffy/Angel and Cabin in the Woods all feature otherworldly threats and secret government organisations (the Initiative trying to exploit them, the Conspiracy trying to appease them, and Shield trying to combat them). Humanity may have left Earth to establish the Firefly/Serenity colonies after the Cabin in the Woods and Dollhouse apocalypses, and this would explain Paris being in ruins at the end of Alien: Resurrection. We also have the doll Miss Edith belonging to vampire Drusilla from Buffy/Angel in the basement in Cabin in the Woods; and Thor glimpsing the three figures dressed as a Wolf, a Ram and Hart in his dream in Avengers; Age of Ultron; Wolfram and Hart being the villains from Angel.",The Avengers (2012)
What continuity points from other Marvel movies are addressed in this film?,"Being a direct sequel to all prior Marvel Studios films, some loose details in the previous films have been addressed in order to maintain or expand the canonicity for each main character's solo franchise:

Professor Erik Selvig (from Thor) has been working with S.H.I.E.L.D. to turn the Tesseract into a limitless power source. He recognizes Loki just before being turned into a puppet mentally controlled by Loki himself (as foretold in the post-credits sequence in Thor). Later in the film, he is used (due to his knowledge of the Tesseract) to open the dimensional portal.

Jane Foster's absence in the film is explained by Agent Coulson who, being aware of the coming threats, tells Thor she had been sent to a remote and secure location in Tromsø, Norway.

The new Stark Tower is finished, which was 12% (one could argue 15%) personally designed by Pepper Potts, suggesting that she and Tony Stark really started a relationship by the end of Iron Man 2, and that Stark is becoming less egocentric, one small step at a time. The construction marks a significant gap of time between that film and The Avengers. Also, Tony Stark states that he's now in the clean energy business, which could potentially connect with Iron Man 3.

The ambiguous ending in The Incredible Hulk is finally explained, showing that Dr. Bruce Banner has finally come to embrace The Hulk, even to the point of transforming at will but usually preferring not to.

The mystery marksman briefly shown in Thor is revealed to be Hawkeye, who is established as having joined S.H.I.E.L.D. before The Black Widow did, given the fact that he recruited her some time ago, mentioning several missions together prior to her appearance in Iron Man 2. Hints at a sexual tension are present between both characters throughout the movie.

Coulson attacks Loki with a weapon created from the remains of the Destroyer that appeared in Thor.

Loki reminds Thor that they are not truly brothers; that he is, in fact, the son of Laufey, King of the Frost Giants of Jötunheim. Thor later says (in a moment of humor) that Loki is adopted.

The Tesseract (Captain America: The First Avenger's MacGuffin) is central to this film's story, having been found by Howard Stark while trying to locate Steve Rogers in the Arctic. It's been used as a prototype limitless power source until Loki comes into play.

Steve Rogers is clearly nostalgic/angry due the loss of his allies and friends from the 1940s and by the decades he's missed in his 70 years of suspended animation; therefore, he has been very recently awakened. This is reinforced by several jokes at his expense, particularly his anachronistic demeanor and his ignorance of modern technology and references.

Loki questions how Thor was able to travel to Earth due to the destruction of the Bifrost, and implies that Odin had to summon dark power to send him to Earth.

A subplot shows how HYDRA's weaponry, found at the time Captain America was rescued, has been reverse-engineered by S.H.I.E.L.D. as official weaponry in case the Avengers Initiative fails.

Bruce Banner states that the last time he was in New York, he ""kind of broke Harlem."" This is in reference to his battle against the Abomination at the end of The Incredible Hulk.

Agent Coulson is an obsessive fan of Captain America, even having trading cards, a callback to the Captain America merchandise.

Loki is back due to Thanos' intervention. He gave Loki the scepter to lead the Chitauri army, and his presence will lead to further cosmic conflicts in succeeding Marvel Studios films.",The Avengers (2012)

What is 'Iron Man 3' about?,"Still suffering from posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) following the events in The Avengers (2012), Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) deals with his insomnia by spending his sleepless nights designing new prototypes of the Mark-42 Iron Man suit. The suits come in handy when the mysterious Mandarin (Ben Kingsley), a villainous terrorist, steals TV broadcast time, threatens the United States as well as President Ellis (William Sadler), stages a devastating attack on the Chinese Theater in Los Angeles, and sends Tony's Malibu mansion tumbling into the ocean. When Tony and Colonel James Rhodes (Don Cheadle) finally track down the Mandarin, Tony discovers that an event from 1999 is also connected to the present terrorist attacks.",Iron Man 3 (2013)
Is 'Iron Man 3' based on a book?,"Iron Man 3 is the third movie in the Iron Man film series, preceded by Iron Man (2008) and Iron Man 2 (2010). The character of Iron Man is based on a comic book of the same name created by Marvel Comics editor Stan Lee and artists Don Heck and Jack Kirby. Iron Man first appeared in issue #39 of Tales of Suspense (March 1963). The story for Iron Man 3 was based on ""Extremis"", a six-issue story arc from the comic book series Iron Man (vol. 4), published in issues 1 through 6, in 2005 and 2006, by Marvel comics. The screenplay for Iron Man 3 was written by American filmmaker Shane Black (who also directed) and British screenwriter Drew Pearce.",Iron Man 3 (2013)
Why does the Mandarin have Captain America's shield tattooed on his neck?,"The reason for this is not directly referenced in the film and is left to the viewer's interpretation. It has been noted that the star in the center of the shield has been replaced with an ""A"", the symbol for anarchy. Kevin Feige has said that the Mandarin uses ""symbolism of various cultures and iconography that he perverts for his own end."" A popular theory is that he is attempting to twist the ideals the shield represents. This fits in with the speech that he gives in the film: ""Ladies, children, sheep... Some people call me a terrorist. I consider myself a teacher. Lesson number one: Heroes, there is no such thing.""",Iron Man 3 (2013)
"Why couldn't Tony Stark use the arc reactor in his chest to charge his ""Mk-42"" armour?","The complex design of the Mark 42 made for some unique properties: Each piece of independent armor had to have its own power supply to utilize the repulsor/anti-gravity flight capacity and each piece had to be able to independently and cooperatively know where it needed to be and in what order it needed to arrive to make the suit viable upon receipt: this means they were all capable of managing their own power resources. Each unit is capable of functioning independent of any other pieces (see Tony's unconventional one hand, one foot aerial ballet of destruction) and thus they are likely not able to be easily recharged unless the suit is in one piece. The Mark 42 did not seem to be as physically strong as some of the other designs, possibly because of its very modular nature. Since the suit was designed to fit people other than Stark himself—we see Pepper using it quite well—it makes sense to have the suit function without a direct link to the Arc reactor in Tony's chest. It also makes sense to allow the suit to be recharged on ordinary electricity in the event Stark is not around (as it proved to be a useful feature). Recharging on ordinary electricity was a feature of the comic version of Iron Man from the very first designs. His suits were designed to absorb solar energy constantly, absorb some electromagnetic energy from his enemies or to be powered directly from land-based power supplies. He could even link his armor to land based power supplies to augment his strength briefly.",Iron Man 3 (2013)
How does the movie end?,"After Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow), whose Extremis powers allowed her to survive the fall, kills Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce), Tony orders JARVIS to destroy the Iron Man suits as proof that he's going to spend more time with Pepper and less time in his lab. The next day, Vice President Rodriquez (Miguel Ferrer) and Trevor Slattery (Ben Kingsley) are arrested. In a voiceover, Tony explains that he was able to cure Pepper and to undergo surgery to remove the shrapnel embedded near his heart. Happy Hogan (Jon Favreau) awakes from his coma, and Harley Keener (Ty Simpkins) comes home from school to find his garage laboratory rebuilt, replete with a brand new potato gun. In the final scene, Tony tosses his old chest arc reactor off the cliff where his mansion used to stand. ""My armor?"", he asks. It was never a distraction or a hobby. It was a cocoon. And now I'm a changed man. You can take away my house...all my tricks and toys. One thing you can't take away: I am Iron Man.",Iron Man 3 (2013)
Is there anything after the credits?,"Yes: Tony Stark can be seen lying on a sofa in a doctor's office.

In the Collector's case, he is obsessed with collecting various objects and beings, often without regard for the proper ownership or liberties involved. He appears again in Guardians of the Galaxy (2014)",Thor: The Dark World (2013)
What are the Infinity Stones?,"The Infinity Stones (Infinity Gems) are items with reality-altering powers that exceed every other force or power shown so far in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). When all of them are collected in an Infinity Gauntlet, the wielder is given power to destroy complete universes. Up to this point, a Infinity Gauntlet have been revealed, the right-handed one that was briefly shown in Thor (2011) inside Odin's chambers. It's hinted that only extraordinary individuals can survive touching the Stones barehanded, and even in that case, it requires a great willpower to use the power of the Stones without a Gauntlet itself. Although the Stones had not yet been explicitly mentioned in the MCU at this point, several of them had already come by up. In a proper filmmaking point of view, these are the MacGuffin that keeps the entire MCU franchise united. At the end of The Dark World, three of the six Stones have been revealed and located:


Blue (Space Gem): Hidden inside the Tesseract, it can open portals to between universes. First seen in Captain America: The First Avenger (2011) (2011), where the Red Skull located it in a Norwegian monastery and used its energy to create highly advance weaponry during World War II. It's hinted in Iron Man 2 (2010) (2010) that the original Arc Reactor technology used by Iron Man was designed based on knowledge Howard Stark once he recovered the Tesseract. In The Avengers, Loki and a mind-controlled Erik Selvig use it to open a portal to let the Chitauri army enter the Earth. Also, it's revealed that S.H.I.E.L.D designed new weaponry based on Tesseract technology as a backup in case the Avengers Indicative would fail. After Loki's defeat, Thor took it back to Asgard. It's kept in Odin's chambers and accessible to Loki once again, as well as the aforementioned Infinity Gauntlet, having taken control of Asgard during the events of The Dark World.


Red (Reality Gem): Hidden inside the Aether, it has the ability to transform matter into dark matter. First seen in The Dark World, thousands of years ago in a war where King Bor of Asgard (father of Odin) defeated Malekith, leader of the dark elves. In modern times, Dr. Jane Foster discovered it once again while studying gravitational disturbances in London, putting her own life in danger. During the events of the Convergence, Malekith briefly took control of it inside his body, rendering him near invincible. After Thor's victory over him, it was handed over to the Collector to avoid having two Infinity Stones together in the same place. The Collector's alliances and ultimate goal were unknown at this point.


Yellow (Mind Gem): Hidden inside Loki's scepter, it has the ability to control minds as well as create new ones, such as Ultron and the Vision. First seen in The Avengers when it is assumed that Thanos himself or The Other (leader of the Chitauri army) gave it to Loki. With it, Loki stabbed and killed Agent Phil Coulson, causing Iron Man, Black Widow, Thor, Captain America, Haweye and Hulk to unite to avenge him. Natasha Romanoff (Black Widow) used it to close the portal Loki and a mind-controlled Dr. Selvig created it to let the Chitauri army attack New York. S.H.I.E.L.D. took it under custody for study.


Purple (Power Gem): Yet to be revealed.


Green (Time Stone): Yet to be revealed.

Who is Sam Wilson aka The Falcon?,"The Falcon is a Marvel Comics character who premiered in Sept 1969 in Captain America #117 and created by Stan Lee and Gene Colan. He and Captain America eventually became close partners, especially in the 1970s when the comic was retitled Captain America and the Falcon from 1971 to 1977. His abilities include an uncanny ability to communicate with birds (An ability given by the Red Skull when he used the Cosmic Cube to reform Sam's personality for his own ends) and being in excellent physical condition. In addition, he wears a special harness supplied by King T'Challa, also known as Black Panther of Wakanda, that enables him to fly.",Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014)
How do Falcon's powers and origin differ from the comics?,"In the movie, the Falcon has no biological super powers. Instead, he is a U.S. military veteran who is well-trained in hand-to-hand-combat and the use of a special winged flight suit giving him the ability to fly. Not much is revealed about his past in the movie, but his military background is considerably different from his comic origin in the mainstream comics as a conflicted urban youth who turns to crime for a while before turning to good after meeting Captain America. In the film, his flight suit is implied to have come from Stark Industries instead of from the Black Panther in the mainstream comics. His name in the movie comes from the government code-name for the flight suit he uses, instead of being his self-given superhero name as in the comics. His military background, lack of super powers, and the appearance of his flight suit are actually based around the version of the Falcon from Marvel Comic's Ultimate Marvel imprint, where he wore military clothes with his flight suit instead of his traditional red- and white-colored Falcon-themed costume.",Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014)
What is the World Security Council? Who are its members?,"The World Security Council is an international organization whose stated aims are facilitating cooperation in international law, international security, economic development, social progress, human rights, and achievement of world peace. They run S.H.I.E.L.D.'s operations. Five of them appear in the film: Jenny Agutter reprising her role as a World Security Council member from The Avengers (2012), along with Robert Redford's Alexander Pierce serving as a World Security Council member and senior leader within S.H.I.E.L.D., Chin Han as World Security Councilman Yen, with Bernard White and Alan Dale as the two remaining World Security Council members to appear. One other World Security Council member or former member, Powers Boothe's character, who appears in The Avengers, is missing this time around; the third season of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. (2013–), wherein he resurfaces, providing some insight as to the reason for the absence. In general, it would seem that only five person serve on the council at a time. In the aftermath of The Winter Soldier, the council is disbanded. As of mid-2017, the whereabouts/fates of World Security Councilwoman Hawley (Agutter) and the two never-identified World Security Councilmen (played by Arthur Darbinyan and Donald Li) from The Avengers are unrevealed.",Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014)
Who is Sharon Carter?,"Sharon Carter, alias Agent 13, is a secret agent in the Marvel Comics universe. She is an ex-field agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. under Nick Fury and occasionally the girlfriend of Captain America. In original continuity, Sharon was said to be the younger sister of Peggy Carter, the wartime love interest of Captain America, but she was later reconnected as Peggy's niece because of the unaging nature of comic book characters. At first she is known as ""Kate"", but Black Widow identifies her simply as ""Sharon"". While the film makes no definite connection between the two, Sharon does mention an aunt after Steve visits the elderly Peggy.",Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014)
Who is Crossbones?,"Brock Rumlow a.k.a. ""Crossbones"" is a super villain in the Marvel Comics universe. He is a world-class hand-to-hand fighter with extensive experience in street-fighting and various martial arts and military combat techniques. Crossbones usually appears as a henchman of the Red Skull, and has a super villain costume of black combat gear and a black and white skull mask. In the film, he is a S.H.I.E.L.D operative, without a costume, who is revealed to be a double agent working for the villain. Near the end of the film, he can be seen in a bed with two straps crossing over his chest, resembling his logo.",Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014)
Who is Batroc?,"Batroc the Leaper, real name Georges Batroc, is Marvel villain who lacks superpowers and is a highly trained French martial artist whose most powerful attribute are his legs (hence the nickname). In the comics he has battled many different heroes but is primarily an adversary of Captain America. In the film he is still a powerful martial artist and battles Steve Rogers aboard a pirated ship. While he demonstrates that his legs are powerful, the ""Leaper"" part of the name has been removed from the movie.",Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014)
Where is Stan Lee's cameo?,"Stan Lee appears as a guard at the Smithsonian, saying, ""I'm so fired"", after Steve Rogers steals his original Captain America uniform.",Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014)
What is the future of S.H.I.E.L.D.?,"In the finale of the first season of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., it is revealed that Coulson would take over as director of S.H.I.E.L.D. and rebuild it from the beginning. While this does ultimately become the case at some point relatively quickly, the organization overseen by Coulson experiences struggles with its authenticity; plus, for years, the general public and others outside the web of secrecy are largely unable to distinguish between SHIELD and HYDRA.",Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014)
What are the end credit scenes?,"There are two end credit sequences, one mid-credits and one at the very end. The mid-credit scene introduces Baron von Strucker, one of villains in Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015), who is overseeing a secret HYDRA research facility which is experimenting on Loki's staff. He then looks into a cell at ""the twins"", who are Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch, who appear in Avengers: Age of Ultron. In the comics, Baron von Strucker is a HYDRA villain from World War II who often fought internally with Red Skull over control of the evil organization. How he differs in the Marvel Cinematic Universe is not yet completely known. Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch are the children of Magneto from the X-Men comics. They start as villains like their father, but later look to become heroes and are taken in as Avengers. This is different in the Marvel Cinematic Universe because Marvel Studios does not have the rights to Magneto and therefore cannot reference them as mutants or even offspring of Magneto, but von Strucker still implies in the movie that they were born with their powers, hence him saying ""the age of miracles"". The second end credit sequence shows Bucky the Winter Soldier visiting the Captain America exhibit at the National Air and Space Museum, in order to discover his own identity. Also, the United States flag can be seen behind him. This may allude to the fact that Winter Soldier learns to become a hero in the comics and even becomes Captain America when Steve Rogers is believed dead.",Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014)
What references to other heroes are there?,"There are several references to Tony Stark/Iron Man, Stark Industries, and Bruce Banner in dialog throughout the film. Natasha Romanov can be seen using an arrow necklace, referencing her SHIELD partner, Clint Barton. At one point, Stephen Strange (aka Doctor Strange), whose own film is in development, is mentioned as a potential future threat to HYDRA. In that same scene, a man in Cairo, Egypt is also mentioned. While this is not too specific, mentioning that among other names has lead to fan speculation that it is a reference to the mercenary and combat strategist, Moon Knight. One of the buildings targeted by the helicarrier is the Baxter Building, home of the Fantastic Four. When it was revealed that Nick Fury was alive, he stated that he used Tetrodotoxin-B, a neurotoxin developed by Bruce Banner (Hulk) originally to control his rage, in order to make his pulse undetectable, although it is revealed later that the surgeon operating on Fury knew of the plan. Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch, set to appear in Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015) (2015), are shown in a mid-credits scene.",Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014)
What happened with Senator Stern?,"When we first see Senator Stern in this movie he and SHIELD Agent Jasper Sitwell are having a conversation where Stern whispers, ""Hail Hydra"", to Sitwell. It is implied that HYDRA's reach has expanded beyond SHIELD to members of the government including Senator Stern. During the events of Iron Man 2 (2010), Senator Stern asks Tony to surrender ""the Iron Man weapon"" to the U.S. Army; but, following this revelation in The Winter Soldier, it is implied that his real concern was never for the U.S. Government, but rather him removing Tony Stark as a heroic threat and delivering the armor to HYDRA. He is arrested at the end of the film. It is revealed in the TV show Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. that they use brainwashing technology to forcibly recruit HYDRA members.",Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014)
"Why didn't Tony Stark discover HYDRA's secret when he hacked SHIELD during ""The Avengers""?","How could he have? SHIELD existed for almost 70 years without anyone successfully discovering the secret HYDRA conspiracy. Even Nick Fury himself, with one of the highest clearances in the organization, didn't figure it out until it was almost too late. Arnim Zola explains that Howard Stark, Tony's father, may have begun to suspect or even found proof, but he was killed for this knowledge. By the modern age, HYDRA clearly understood the importance of leaving no paper or digital trail of their conspiracy on SHIELD computers where anyone could hack it. Besides, Tony Stark's immediate goal when hacking SHIELD was only to find their true intent with the Tesseract, which was known as Phase Two, and the immediate threat of Loki didn't leave him time to study the rest of the data and find such a deeply rooted secret.",Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014)
Why did Arnim Zola allow himself to be blown up after working so hard to save his brain?,"He hardly had a choice. It was S.H.I.E.L.D./HYDRA that sent the missile to kill Captain America and Black Widow as they stood inside Zola's computer brain. S.H.I.E.L.D./HYDRA didn't see any value in the computer brain of Arnim Zola any longer, evident by the fact that he had been ignored and not updated for decades, so destroying him was of little concern to them. As for Zola himself not caring about his own ""death,"" his last moments seem filled with joy and certainty that he has beaten Captain America, so he appears happy to go out in a blaze of dramatic glory. Also, not to forget, whenever his body is damaged, or utterly destroyed, Arnim is able to send his personality to another one stored elsewhere, thus giving himself a form of immortality. So, there could be a possibility that in the future movies, we can encounter Zola in another form. Also, we see that there was a modern USB hub hooked up to Zola's interface. Natasha plugs in the USB stick to it and activates Zola. It's likely that another HYDRA agent, such as Baron Von Strucker had gone there previously and backed up Zola onto another drive.",Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014)
Why didn't they seek help from the rest of the Avengers?,"After Cap became a fugitive, Agent Sitwell establishes a Level 1 priority on him. The latter specifies that he wants every form of communication to be monitored in the hunt for Cap (""If someone tweets about this guy, I wanna know about it""). It's only common sense that they would also monitor and filter any contact with the rest of the Avengers, which is why Cap and Widow sought the help of a non-active Airman like Falcon instead. Another reason for this, as given by the directors is that the entire movie takes place in a span of over 3 days which is far too small a time-span for Cap to try to contact and assemble the avengers. After the movie is over, however, he does contact the Avengers for help, since at the beginning of Avengers: Age of Ultron, the Avengers are finishing up a long campaign to defeat Hydra.",Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014)
What is Guardians of the Galaxy about?,"On the populated planet Xandar. A cocky and idiotic thief called Peter ""Star Lord"" Quill gets into a fight with a woman called Gamora who snatches from him a mysterious orb which he retrieved on the desolate planet Morag. However, a short tempered amateur bounty hunter a enhanced racoon named Rocket and his sidekick, a humanoid tree creature named Groot interfere and attempt to capture Quill, so they can claim the bounty on his head and Quill, Gamora, Rocket and Groot are arrested by the local police force the Nova Corps. Escaping from the penal space station 'The Kyln' along with Drax the Destroyer, a reckless criminal who helped them escape, Quill, Gamora, Rocket and Groot head to the lawless mining colony Knowwhere to give the orb to a antiques dealer called The Collector in exchange for profit. After discovering the orb contains an 'Infinity Stone' one of six crystals which according to legend was created at the beginning of time. Knowwhere is attacked by Ronan the Accuser, a terrorist who has formed an alliance with Gamora's adopted father, the intergalactic tyrant Thanos and Ronan has come to Knowwhere to take the Infinity Stone and give it to Thanos and Ronan intends to use the Infinity Stone to destroy Xandar in retaliation for the death of his family. Realizing Xandar is in mortal danger, Quill, Gamora, Rocket, Groot and Drax join forces with The Ravagers, a band of space pirates led by Quill's adopted father Yondu Udonta and the Nova Corps as they set out to defend Xandar from Ronan who invades Xandar with his warrior army and Gamora's jealous adopted sister, the cyborg Nebula and Quill and the Guardians of the Galaxy set out to stop Ronan and save Xandar from destruction.",Guardians of the Galaxy (2014)
Who are the Guardians of the Galaxy?,"The Guardians of the Galaxy are a fictional superhero team published in Marvel Comics. From what has been confirmed so far, this film is based on the 2008 modern day incarnation thought up by Dan Abnett and Andy Lanning, not to be confused with the 1969 future version of the same group. Its members consist of Drax the Destroyer, Groot, Star-Lord, Rocket Raccoon, Major Victory, Phyla-Vell, Mantis, Cosmo, Bug, Moondragon, Adam Warlock and Gamora. They often team up with Nova, Quasar and the Inhumans, among other intergalactic characters. They have fought Annihilus, Thanos, Vulcan (Cyclops and Havoc's brother) and The Phalanx under Ultron's leadership. Drax the Destroyer, whose alias is Arthur Douglas, is a deceased human turned into a huge green space warrior created to specifically kill Thanos. Gamora is a lone survivor of her alien race who served as a former agent to (and is the adopted daughter of) Thanos. Star-Lord, whose alias is Peter Quill, is a half human, half Spartan intergalactic soldier. Groot is an extraterrestrial tree-like creature who is royalty on his homeworld and can regenerate most devastating wounds as a plant can. Rocket Raccoon is an intelligent, anthropomorphic raccoon created on Earth to be an expert marksman and master tactician.",Guardians of the Galaxy (2014)
Who are the villains?,"The main villain is Ronan the Accuser (Lee Pace). Nebula (Karen Gillan) and Korath (Djimon Hounsou) are secondary villains who serve Ronan. The Collector (Benicio Del Toro) and Thanos (Josh Brolin) also make minor appearances but pose no direct threat to the Guardians. Since the character Yondu (Michael Rooker) serves as a foil to the main protagonist Peter Quill/Star-Lord, he can be considered a minor antagonist. Collector, while cruel to his slave, is not a villain, but rather serves as a buyer for the Infinity Stone.",Guardians of the Galaxy (2014)
Was this Thanos' first screen appearance?,"No, Thanos previously appeared during the closing credits of The Avengers (2012), where he was played by stuntman Damion Poitier.",Guardians of the Galaxy (2014)
What is the Nova Corps?,"The Nova Corps is a stateless interstellar police force in the Marvel Comics Universe, very similar to the Green Lantern Corps in the DC Comics Universe in many respects. The basic concept was introduced Nova vol. 1 #1 in September 1976 while the full organization introduced in Fantastic Four # 208. The main stylistic differences is that while the GLC members are primarily armed with a ring that can do nearly anything that the wearer has the imagination and willpower to create, the Nova Corps troopers are granted innate powers that are much like Superman's power set in many respects, such as super strength, flight, resistance to injury and power blasts from their bodies. Furthermore, they require more elaborate equipment for their operations such as their uniforms which have additional functions like built in communications and a life support system while using ships for long range space travel. Another notable difference between the two organizations is that the Nova Corps is a militia proper, featuring a formal ranking system (e.g. Corpsman, Millennians, Denarians, Centurions, etc). The Green Lantern Corps has no such system.",Guardians of the Galaxy (2014)
What's the obsession with Peter Quill and his cassette player?,"During a scene where Peter is talking to Gamora and lets her listen to music, he reveals that the cassette player reminds him of his time on Earth, or Terra, as they refer to it. At the beginning of the film, we see Quill's mother is about to die and gives a present to Peter during her last seconds. At the end of the movie it was revealed that the present was another cassette that read ""Awesome Mix. Vol 2"". Since Peter Quill was born around the 1980's, most of the tracks that are recorded in those cassettes represent special moments in his life. It's one of the symbols that show that Peter is human, just like the insides of his spaceship, the Milano. It also represents an emotional attachment that Peter has to his mother, and it makes perfect sense since his mother was actually human. That is why, during his prison escape with the rest of the Guardians, he refuses to leave without retrieving his cassette player.",Guardians of the Galaxy (2014)
Is there a post-credits scene?,"Yes. Back in Knowhere, a bandaged Collector stands in the rubble of his lair, while one of his collections, the cosmonaut dog, comes by and licks him. A voice asks the annoyed Collector, ""Why do you let him lick you like that?"" The voice is revealed to be that of Howard the Duck, voiced by Seth Green.",Guardians of the Galaxy (2014)
Where is Stan Lee's cameo in this movie?,Stan Lee is seen on the planet Xandar. Rocket spots him with a younger woman and berates him for cheating on his wife. He laughs and calls him a Pervert.,Guardians of the Galaxy (2014)
"Does this have a connection to the ""The Avengers"", ""S.H.I.E.L.D."" etc.?","Yes. This film is part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, the same universe as Iron Man (2008), The Incredible Hulk (2008), Iron Man 2 (2010), Thor (2011) Captain America: The First Avenger (2011) The Avengers (2012) Iron Man Three (2013) Thor: The Dark World (2013), Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014) , Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015) and Ant-Man (2015). This film is part of Phase 2 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe setting up Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015). It takes place largely away from planet Earth (as does the comic book). In the mid-credits scene of Thor: The Dark World, Lady Sif and Volstagg bring the Aether to the Collector, who is played by Benicio Del Toro. When the Collector asks him why they are giving him the Aether, Lady Sif and Volstagg respond that they already have the Tesseract in Odin's vault on Asgard, and it would be unsafe to keep two Infinity Stones in one place. After Lady Sif and Volstagg leave, the Collector says, ""One down, five to go"". This scene serves a link between Thor: The Dark World and Guardians of the Galaxy. One important highlight of this scene is Adam Warlock's cocoon, which can be seen when Volstagg and Lady Sif are entering The Collector's vault.

In the comics, the stones were fastened to the Infinity Gauntlet, which is also stored in Odin's vault and was briefly seen in Thor. Thanos gets hold of the Infinity Gauntlet and has fought The Avengers on many occasions. Gamora is also Thanos' adopted daughter, which could have implications to her background as an assassin. It is possible that the film and the Marvel Cinematic Universe could follow this trend. Since this film takes place in outer space, referencing other characters and films was somewhat difficult. Most of the action that's happening in the Marvel Cinematic Universe occurs on Earth, so it seems there won't be any interaction with the Avengers for now. Even though this film has limited references compared to the rest of the films, there are still some that help establish a connection between them. During a scene when the Guardians visit the Collector, a Chitauri mask can be seen, referencing the events that took place in The Avengers. There is also a Dark Elf mask from Thor: The Dark World, which is shown while Carina is cleaning the cage. In the after-credits scene, Adam Warlock's cocoon is seen again, this time in the background, but it is now open, probably due to the explosion after Carina touched the Infinity Stone. Shortly after the film's release, director James Gunn confirmed that Adam Warlock would thenceforth be a part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.",Guardians of the Galaxy (2014)

What are the Infinity Stones? In what movies can they be found?,"The Infinity Stones (Infinity Gems) are items with reality-altering powers that exceed every other force or power shown so far in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). When all of them are collected in an Infinity Gauntlet, the wielder is given power to destroy complete universes. Up to this point, a Infinity Gauntlet have been revealed, the right-handed one that was briefly shown in Thor (2011) inside Odin's chambers. It's hinted that only extraordinary individuals can survive touching the Stones barehanded, and even in that case, it requires a great willpower to use the power of the Stones without a Gauntlet itself. Although the Stones had not yet been explicitly mentioned in the MCU at this point, several of them had already come by up. In a proper filmmaking point of view, these are the MacGuffin that keeps the entire MCU franchise united. At the end of The Dark World, three of the six Stones have been revealed and located:


Blue (Space Gem): Hidden inside the Tesseract, it can open portals to between universes. First seen in Captain America: The First Avenger (2011) (2011), where the Red Skull located it in a Norwegian monastery and used its energy to create highly advance weaponry during World War II. It's hinted in Iron Man 2 (2010) (2010) that the original Arc Reactor technology used by Iron Man was designed based on knowledge Howard Stark once he recovered the Tesseract. In The Avengers, Loki and a mind-controlled Erik Selvig use it to open a portal to let the Chitauri army enter the Earth. Also, it's revealed that S.H.I.E.L.D designed new weaponry based on Tesseract technology as a backup in case the Avengers Indicative would fail. After Loki's defeat, Thor took it back to Asgard. It's kept in Odin's chambers and accessible to Loki once again, as well as the aforementioned Infinity Gauntlet, having taken control of Asgard during the events of The Dark World.


Red (Reality Gem): Hidden inside the Aether, it has the ability to transform matter into dark matter. First seen in The Dark World, thousands of years ago in a war where King Bor of Asgard (father of Odin) defeated Malekith, leader of the dark elves. In modern times, Dr. Jane Foster discovered it once again while studying gravitational disturbances in London, putting her own life in danger. During the events of the Convergence, Malekith briefly took control of it inside his body, rendering him near invincible. After Thor's victory over him, it was handed over to the Collector to avoid having two Infinity Stones together in the same place. The Collector's alliances and ultimate goal were unknown at this point.


Yellow (Mind Gem): Hidden inside Loki's scepter, it has the ability to control minds as well as create new ones, such as Ultron and the Vision. First seen in The Avengers when it is assumed that Thanos himself or The Other (leader of the Chitauri army) gave it to Loki. With it, Loki stabbed and killed Agent Phil Coulson, causing Iron Man, Black Widow, Thor, Captain America, Haweye and Hulk to unite to avenge him. Natasha Romanoff (Black Widow) used it to close the portal Loki and a mind-controlled Dr. Selvig created it to let the Chitauri army attack New York. S.H.I.E.L.D. took it under custody for study.


Purple (Power Gem): Hidden inside The Orb. First seen in Guardians of the Galaxy, it has the ability to destroy entire planets at a molecular level. In a distant, unknown past, an old being called Celestial is depicted using it to eradicate life in a planet with a single blow. At some point of this remote past, it was guarded in planet Morag and lost in time until Peter Quill (aka Starlord) seized it from the planet's ruins just minutes before Kree soldiers under the command of Ronan the Accuser retrieve it. Ronan had the intention of wiping out the Nova Prime civilization as a revenge against them for an ancient war. Having each their own separated agendas, scavenger leader Yondu and The Collector (who at this point already has the Reality Gem), want to take control of it. Both Ronan and Starlord are seen surviving while using it barehanded for a short time. Following the failed massacre by Ronan, the Nova Corps, a planetary law enforcing organization, are protecting it.

Orange (Soul Stone): Yet to be revealed.


These remaining two Stones and their respective powers are revealed over the course of MCU's Phase 3—comprised of Captain America: Civil War (2016), Doctor Strange (2016), Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (2017), Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017), Thor: Ragnarok (2017) and Black Panther (2018), culminating in Avengers: Infinity War (2018) and Avengers: Endgame (2019), with Ant-Man and the Wasp (2018) and Captain Marvel (2019). Doctor Strange expands on the mythology surrounding the Infinity Gauntlet and reveals the Time Stone. Thor revealed that he would return to Asguard to learn more about the Infinity Stones; the backstory of which, the Infinity Stones and their creation may be unveiled in Thor: Ragnarok.",Guardians of the Galaxy (2014)
Who's fault Ultron and the Battle of Sokovia happened?,"Tony Stark. He originally created Ultron as a peacekeeping program but he was smarter than Stark realized. Ultron was crazy about human extinction and when he broke loose he worked to accomplish it, leading to the Battle of Sokovia.",Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015)
Which superheroes are featured in this film?,"The original six also featured in The Avengers (2012) are: • Tony Stark / Iron Man • Steve Rogers / Captain America • Bruce Banner / The Hulk • Thor Odinson • Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow • Clint Barton / Hawkeye   Other superheroes featured: • James ""Rhodey"" Rhodes / War Machine • Sam Wilson / The Falcon • The Vision • Wanda Maximoff / Scarlet Witch • Pietro Maximoff / Quicksilver",Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015)
Who are the villains in this this film?,"Baron von Strucker (Thomas Kretschmann): A HYDRA leader who pursues experiments on humans, including the Maximoff twins. Also, he is on possession of Loki's Scepter and continuously studying the Chitauri and Leviathans in his fortress.


Ultron (James Spader): The main villain. A peacekeeping artificial intelligence gone evil, created by Tony Stark and Bruce Banner with data extracted from the Mind Gem.


Wanda Maximoff/Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) and Pietro Maximoff/Quicksilver (Aaron Taylor-Johnson): Twin siblings who accepted to be ""enhanced"" by von Strucker in order to take revenge from Tony Stark (Iron Man) after missiles designed by him killed their parents. They are later recruited by Ultron to help him defeat Stark along with the Avengers.


Ulysses Klaue (Andy Serkis): An arms dealer with ties to both von Strucker and Tony Stark (Iron Man). This film also serves to introduce a small origin story on how he became Klaw.",Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015)
Who or what is the Vision?,"As Tony Stark and Bruce Banner integrate the data collected from Loki's Scepter into the Ultron Program, it's just a matter of hours before Ultron acquires sentience. JARVIS attempts to keep it contained and under control but fails, then is ""killed"" by Ultron. Ultron at first tries to hack nuclear weaponry to wipe out mankind, but a mysterious hacker keeps him from achieving it. Stark reveals that the hacker was actually JARVIS itself, having survived in part. Bruce Banner explains to the team that Ultron wants to evolve, and concludes that Doctor Cho's tissue regenerator, the Mind Gem and the Vibranium Ultron obtained from Ulysses Klaue are the key to creating an indestructible final form for Ultron. Such a body would resemble biological tissue but be as resistant to damage as Captain America's shield. As Ultron is transferring his mind into this body, he's interrupted and the body itself taken by the Avengers. Stark uses JARVIS' surviving code as a new mind for the Vibranium body and Thor overpowers the body and the Mind Gem, thus creating a new, benign lifeform that identifies as someone ""on life's side"", worthy of lifting Thor's hammer and far more powerful than Ultron. Both Thor and Ultron called it ""the Vision"". Its exact nature, as well as how much of JARVIS or the Mind Gem is part of his personality is unknown.",Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015)
Does Hank Pym appear in this movie?,"No. Even though Michael Douglas was cast as Hank Pym in Ant-Man (2015) and his character is essential in a lot of Ultron storylines in the comics, Joss Whedon stated in an interview at the San Diego Comic-Con 2013 that he would not be featured in this film to avoid introducing a third scientist as he already had Stark and Banner. This interpretation of Ultron is created by Tony Stark and Bruce Banner, but they take concept of the peacekeeping artificial intelligence and the name ""Ultron"" from an abandoned project. We are not told who was responsible for the original project. During the scene where Ultron is born and is looking through JARVIS' files, he examinates a file on Ant-Man.",Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015)
Does S.H.I.E.L.D. feature in this film?,"At the end of Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014), S.H.I.E.L.D. was effectively dismantled, but in the series Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. (2013) (which ran parallel to the Marvel Phase 2 movies up to and after The Winter Soldier), Agent Phil Coulson (Clark Gregg) was made director of the new S.H.I.E.L.D. and tasked with rebuilding the organization from the ground up. In the series, it's this new, small cell that is responsible for finding the location of Loki's Scepter and informs the Avengers, via Maria Hill, thus jumpstarting this film's prologue sequence. Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) reprises his role, in what Jackson has stated to be a ""cameo appearance"", pointing out that he no longer in charge of S.H.I.E.L.D. Cobie Smulders reprises her role as Maria Hill, working directly for Tony Stark this time but maintaining an offscreen communication link with Director Coulson and Nick Fury. Dr. Erik Selvig (Stellan Skarsgård), who helped S.H.I.E.L.D. on the initial study of the Tesseract, makes an appearance. The Helicarrier from The Avengers (2012) is used by Fury as a rescue vessel for Sokovia's inhabitants, and it still carries S.H.I.E.L.D. logos. It could be assumed that Fury and a small crew preserved its control after the fall of S.H.I.E.L.D. Upon its reveal, Captain America remarks that it symbolizes what S.H.I.E.L.D. itself should be.",Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015)
Do any main characters die in the film?,"Yes. Baron Von Strucker is killed by Ultron to send a message to the Avengers. Quicksilver sacrifices himself to save Hawkeye and a child from Ultron's attack with the Quinjet. Ultron is killed twice, the first by Scarlet Witch when she gets revenge on him over her brother's death by ripping out his ""heart"", and later as the last surviving of Ultron's drones is destroyed by Vision.",Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015)
Where is Stan Lee's cameo?,"Stan Lee appears as an Army veteran at Tony Stark's party at the Avengers tower, supposedly one of Captain America's former army buddies. He is seen drinking some of Thor's ale and is carried out of the party passed out, drunkenly saying his famous catchphrase ""Excelsior!""",Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015)
Where did the huge Vibranium rod/column go when the city collapsed?,Into the sea.,Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015)
What are the Infinity Stones? In what movies can they be found?,"The Infinity Stones (Infinity Gems) are items with reality-altering powers that exceed every other force or power shown so far in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). When all of them are collected in an Infinity Gauntlet, the wielder is given power to destroy complete universes. Up to this point, a Infinity Gauntlet have been revealed, the right-handed one that was briefly shown in Thor (2011) inside Odin's chambers. It's hinted that only extraordinary individuals can survive touching the Stones barehanded, and even in that case, it requires a great willpower to use the power of the Stones without a Gauntlet itself. Although the Stones had not yet been explicitly mentioned in the MCU at this point, several of them had already come by up. In a proper filmmaking point of view, these are the MacGuffin that keeps the entire MCU franchise united. At the end of The Dark World, three of the six Stones have been revealed and located:


Blue (Space Gem): Hidden inside the Tesseract, it can open portals to between universes. First seen in Captain America: The First Avenger (2011) (2011), where the Red Skull located it in a Norwegian monastery and used its energy to create highly advance weaponry during World War II. It's hinted in Iron Man 2 (2010) (2010) that the original Arc Reactor technology used by Iron Man was designed based on knowledge Howard Stark once he recovered the Tesseract. In The Avengers, Loki and a mind-controlled Erik Selvig use it to open a portal to let the Chitauri army enter the Earth. Also, it's revealed that S.H.I.E.L.D designed new weaponry based on Tesseract technology as a backup in case the Avengers Indicative would fail. After Loki's defeat, Thor took it back to Asgard. It's kept in Odin's chambers and accessible to Loki once again, as well as the aforementioned Infinity Gauntlet, having taken control of Asgard during the events of The Dark World.


Red (Reality Gem): Hidden inside the Aether, it has the ability to transform matter into dark matter. First seen in The Dark World, thousands of years ago in a war where King Bor of Asgard (father of Odin) defeated Malekith, leader of the dark elves. In modern times, Dr. Jane Foster discovered it once again while studying gravitational disturbances in London, putting her own life in danger. During the events of the Convergence, Malekith briefly took control of it inside his body, rendering him near invincible. After Thor's victory over him, it was handed over to the Collector to avoid having two Infinity Stones together in the same place. The Collector's alliances and ultimate goal were unknown at this point.


Yellow (Mind Gem): Hidden inside Loki's scepter, it has the ability to control minds as well as create new ones, such as Ultron and the Vision. First seen in The Avengers when it is assumed that Thanos himself or The Other (leader of the Chitauri army) gave it to Loki. With it, Loki stabbed and killed Agent Phil Coulson, causing Iron Man, Black Widow, Thor, Captain America, Haweye and Hulk to unite to avenge him. Natasha Romanoff (Black Widow) used it to close the portal Loki and a mind-controlled Dr. Selvig created it to let the Chitauri army attack New York. S.H.I.E.L.D. took it under custody for study.


Purple (Power Gem): Hidden inside The Orb. First seen in Guardians of the Galaxy (2014), it has the ability to destroy entire planets at a molecular level. In a distant, unknown past, an old being called Celestial is depicted using it to eradicate life in a planet with a single blow. At some point of this remote past, it was guarded in planet Morag and lost in time until Peter Quill (aka Starlord) seized it from the planet's ruins just minutes before Kree soldiers under the command of Ronan the Accuser retrieve it. Ronan had the intention of wiping out the Nova Prime civilization as a revenge against them for an ancient war. Having each their own separated agendas, scavenger leader Yondu and The Collector (who at this point already has the Reality Gem), want to take control of it. Both Ronan and Starlord are seen surviving while using it barehanded for a short time. Following the failed massacre by Ronan, the Nova Corps, a planetary law enforcing organization, are protecting it.

Doctor Strange expands on the mythology surrounding the Infinity Gauntlet and reveals the Time Stone. Thor revealed that he would return to Asguard to learn more about the Infinity Stones; the backstory of which, the Infinity Stones and their creation may be unveiled in Thor: Ragnarök.",Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015)
Is there a mid- or post-credits scene?,"Yes, there is an extra scene during the credits about two minutes into the credits featuring Thanos. This scene is meant to serve as a tie-in to the third Avengers film Avengers: Infinity War (2018). However, there is no extra scene after the credits.",Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015)
"Will Iron Man and the Hulk reappear for ""Infinity War"" Parts 1 and 2?","Iron Man and The Hulk may or may not participate in the 2-part Infinity War films. There have been rumors stating that the first part of Infinity War will focus more on the New Avengers, while the second part will focus on all of the Avengers assembling together to battle Thanos. In an interview with GQ, Chris Pratt said that the cast of Guardians of the Galaxy are under contract for multiple films which possibly will include Infinity War and films for the fourth phase of the Marvel Cinematic Univers. Robert Downey Jr. is also under contract to star in Infinity War, but the role that Iron Man will play in both parts is currently unknown. Mark Ruffalo's role in Infinity War is also unknown.",Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015)
Who are the New Avengers?,"At the end of the film, we see Captain America and Black Widow in the New Avengers facility training new members. This new team is composed of Falcon, Scarlet Witch, Vision, and War Machine. In the comics, this team was assembled in case the original Avengers needed a backup or were absent. This team had members switch back and forth, with the original team being Luke Cage, Spider-Man, Wolverine, Captain Marvel, War Machine, and the Thing. There is a television series Luke Cage on Netflix streaming services. It is produced by Marvel Television (which is under the Marvel Studios umbrella) and is understood to be within the same universe as the movies, thereby making him a prospective member. A Captain Marvel film for release in 2019 is in the works as of 2017, so there's a possibility she may become part of this team. Due to film copyright/licensing issues, Wolverine and the Thing are not expected to join this team. As Marvel Studios acquired the Spider-Man film rights from Sony sometime before the production of Captain America: Civil War, he fights alongside Iron Man therein. Ant-Man, who has his own film, is also a good candidate to join this team. However, given the timing of the ""civil war"", the Avengers find themselves in a condition of schism before either Spider-Man or Ant Man get involved, and the latter winds up on the team of fugitive Avengers. In other words, the composition of the New Avengers does not present in quite the way it does in the comic books.",Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015)
Didn't we see the Infinity Gauntlet in Odin's Vault in Asgard?,"That is correct. In the first Thor film, we see the Infinity Gauntlet safely stored in Odin's vault, along with the Eye of Agamotto and other powerful artifacts. However, if you look closely, you will notice that this gauntlet fits a right hand. The one that Thanos puts on in the post-credit scene fits a left hand, which implies that there are two Infinity Gauntlets in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The Infinity Gauntlet in Thor can be viewed here, and the Infinity Gauntlet of Ultron's post-credit scene here.",Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015)
"Why didn't Ultron take control of ""Veronica"" like he did to the Iron Legion?","Stark informs Banner that JARVIS always kept his protocols in effect, which prevented Ultron from accessing devastating weapons via the internet. Unlike Veronica, the Iron Legion was physically accessible to Ultron, allowing him to manually reprogram them.",Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015)
What easter eggs or references to other films are there?,"Cap's New Shield Upgrade: This is a reference straight from the original Avengers comics, as Iron Man also created a device so that Captain America could call his shield back to him


Hawkeye's New Outfit: Both a reference to his original Hawkeye outfit in the comics and his Ronin identity


Dr. Helen Cho: A subtle reference to her son Amadeus, who is actually a genius in scientific breakthroughs involving human healing and combining artificial intelligence with human tissue. In the comics, Amadeus has an important role with these discoveries and also helps the Avengers on many occasions


""Missing Person's Case"": During the party scene at the Avengers Tower, Falcon chats with Cap about him ""still working on that missing person's case"". This is an obvious reference to the events of Captain America: The Winter Soldier, in which Steve and Sam are working together to find Bucky after his disappearance at the end of the film


Crimson Cowl: When Ultron first meets the Maximoff Twins, he is covered in a red cloth. This is a reference to the Crimson Cowl, one of the identities he first took in the comics


The Roy Thomas Players: When Scarlet Witch uses her powers on Captain America, he is induced in a vision where he finally meets with Peggy Carter to have their promised last dance. In this scene, the band playing in the background are known as The Roy Thomas Players. Roy Thomas is actually a comic book writer who co-created and updated several characters in his run, with one of them being Ultron


Wakanda: Although it is only mentioned once by Bruce Banner, Wakanda is a fictional nation in South Africa, home to the Black Panther, Prince T'Challa. Wakanda has an enormous repository of the metal element known as vibranium, the same metal element that makes Captain America's shield indestructible


Ulysses Klaue: One of the most formidable enemies of the Black Panther, Ulysses Klaue is meant to serve as a bridge between the rest of the MCU films and the upcoming Black Panther film. In this film, he gets his arm chopped off by Ultron. In the comics, Klaue lost his arm and replaced it with a claw made of vibranium that could emit intense sound waves. He also murdered King T'Chaka while searching for vibranium in Wakanda, and developed an intense grudge with Black Panther


Star Wars: The fact of Klaue losing a hand is also a reference to Luke Skywalker in Star Wars - Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back. In every Phase Two Marvel film there is a character that loses his/her hand, and Kevin Feige, President of Marvel Studios, has stated that the Marvel Phase Two serves as ""The Empire Strikes Back"" of the MCU storyline. Additionally, the Hulkbuster armor also loses an arm when battling the Hulk


Veronica: Used as a codename by Tony Stark to summon the Hulkbuster armor, this serves as a reference to Betty and Veronica, a comic from Archie Comics, in which two girls fight for the love of one man. Betty Ross is the only woman who has ever been kind to Bruce Banner, while Veronica (the Hulkbuster) is the only one who can stop him in his tracks


Dr. Geoffrey Crawford: During the Hulkbuster/Hulk fight, Hulk is pushed against a delivery truck, which scatters on the street. On the truck and boxes, one can see the name ""Crawford"" written on them. This could serve as a reference to Dr. Crawford, an important figure in the Hulk mythos who attempted to use the Hulk's gamma powers to heal his sickness. The experiment went south and he turned into a Hulk-like creature known as Ravage


Off-Screen Punch: Iron Man punches Hulk off-screen using his Hulkbuster armor. A clear reference to the first Avengers film where Hulk punches Thor off-screen twice


Jocasta: After the birth of Vision, Tony needed the help of another artificial intelligence to help him fight Ultron. When Tony grabs the new AI card named Friday, there are other AI cards across the table and one of them is labeled as Jocasta. Jocasta is actually a bride Ultron made for him modeled after Janet van Dyne, the wife of Ant-Man, the original creator of Ultron


Tadashi: Similar to the Jocasta entry above, when Tony looks through the memory cards, one is named ""Tadashi"". This is a reference to Big Hero Six, as the memory card that holds Baymax's personality and medical knowledge.",Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015)
"What relation does the Quicksilver in this film have to the one in ""X-Men: Days of Future Past""?","They are both interpretations of the same character from the Marvel comics, who plays a major role in both X-Men and Avengers storylines. Quicksilver, and his sister the Scarlet Witch, first appeared as villains, members of Magneto's group ""The Brotherhood of Evil Mutants"". Eventually they reformed, became heroes, and learned that Magneto was their biological father. The Scarlet Witch especially came to be associated mainly with the Avengers and not the X-Men and other mutant teams. While Fox owns the film rights to the X-Men and related properties, Marvel owns the rights to the Avengers. Because Quicksilver was used in both franchises, he was available for use by both studios. However, they reworked his origin for Avengers so as not to reference his being a mutant.",Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015)
How can Hawkeye break Scarlet Witch's mind spell?,"He had already been possessed by Loki in the first Avengers film and this presumably gave him a degree of immunity to mind control. Plus, he has quick reflexes and seems to have blocked her from controlling him simply by reacting faster to her attempt to do so.",Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015)
What is the significance of the figures in Thor's vision?,"They are a Wolf, a Ram and a Hart. Wolfram and Hart were the creators of a demonic law firm in Joss Whedon's series Angel, thus suggesting a link between the two.",Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015)
What Make/Model is the van that picked up Scott Lang from the prison?,1972 Ford Econoline Van,Ant-Man (2015)
Is 'Ant-Man' based on a book?,"Ant-Man is based on the Marvel comic book of the same name created by Stan Lee, Jack Kirby and Larry Lieber.",Ant-Man (2015)
Is this in the same universe as the rest of the Marvel Studios movies?,"Yes, all Marvel Studios films made from 2008 onward are part of a single universe, one of the many parallel story arcs set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). The original Ant-Man, Henry Pym, was a long-time member of the Avengers, under the names Giant-Man, Goliath, and Yellowjacket. Scott Lang was the second person to don the mantel of Ant-Man and was also a member of the Avengers. This film actually marks the final entry in Marvel's Phase Two and sets up (2016)—the third MCU Captain America movie—which starts Phase Three.",Ant-Man (2015)
Which Ant-Man will appear in the film?,Both Hank Pym and Scott Lang will be in the film. Edgar Wright stated that an early draft of the script included Pym being the Ant-Man of the 1960s and Lang being the Ant-Man of the 2010s.,Ant-Man (2015)
Who is Scott Lang?,"Scott Lang is the second person to don the Ant-Man helmet after Dr. Hank Pym. Lang, a burglar, completed his abandoned electrical engineering degree while in prison and was quickly hired by Stark Industries. Left with no choice, he returned to his old trade to save the life of his sick daughter, Cassie. He stole the Ant-Man helmet and used it to free the only scientist that could cure Cassie's illness. Lang returned the helmet to Pym, who agreed to train him as the new Ant-Man. Lang was created by David Michelinie (creator of Venom and writer of the ""Demon in a Bottle"" storyline in the Iron Man comics) and artist John Byrne. He first appeared in the comic books The Avengers #181 (March 1979) and Marvel Premiere #47 (April 1979). In the film, he is a skilled thief and was released from prison during the first act. Dr. Pym was looking for a protégé to take up the Ant-Man mantle, and tricked Scott Lang into stealing the suit after studying him for a few months. Pym then offers Lang a job involving a heist and agrees to train him to become the new Ant-Man.",Ant-Man (2015)
Is there a post-credits scene?,"Yes, there is both a mid-credits scene and a post-credits scene. The mid-credits scene features certain main characters returning and teasing the future roles they'll play, and the stinger after the credits is a huge scene that includes even more key characters and sets up Captain America: Civil War. You can read more details here and here.",Ant-Man (2015)
Where is Stan Lee's cameo?,Stan Lee can be seen towards the end of the movie as a bartender when Luis is telling a story about how Falcon is looking for the Ant-Man.,Ant-Man (2015)
How is it that enlarged objects become heavier and shrunken objects become lighter if they retain their masses?,"In the movie Ant-Man, the ability to shrink and enlarge objects is achieved through the use of Pym particles. When an object is shrunk, its mass is compressed and concentrated into a smaller space, making it appear lighter. Conversely, when an object is enlarged, its mass is spread out over a larger space, making it appear heavier.

However, it is important to note that this portrayal of physics in the movie is fictional and not scientifically accurate. In reality, the mass of an object is determined by the number and type of particles it contains, and does not change when its size is altered. Therefore, the concept of mass being altered by shrinking or enlarging objects is purely a fictional element of the movie.",Ant-Man (2015)
Why bother stealing the Yellowjacket if the plan involves blowing up the entire building in the first place?,"Hank Pym's plan was to steal the Yellowjacket suit from Darren Cross in order to prevent its dangerous technology from falling into the wrong hands. However, after the heist, they discovered that Cross was planning to sell the Yellowjacket suit to Hydra, a terrorist organization.

In order to stop Hydra from obtaining the Yellowjacket suit, Pym and Lang decided to destroy the entire Pym Technologies building, which would also destroy the Yellowjacket suit and all related research. The plan was risky, but it was the only way to prevent the dangerous technology from being used for evil purposes.

So, the main reason for stealing the Yellowjacket suit was to prevent it from being used for evil purposes, and destroying the building was necessary to ensure that the suit and its technology would not fall into the wrong hands.",Ant-Man (2015)
Which characters were adapted from the Marvel comic books?,"Note: For this list only the creators of the characters first appearances are listed. As with all comic book characters, Captain America and his supporting cast have had several reinventions and different contributions from different writers. Theses include different iterations in different mediums that all have added different concepts to the overall mythology of the characters.

Theirs Steven 'Steve' Rogers/Captain America, who made his first appearance in the comic story ""Meet Captain America"" from Captain America Comics #1 (March 1941) by writer Joe Simon and writer/artist Jack Kirby.

Anthony Edward ""Tony"" Stark/Iron Man, referred to as Tony Stark or Iron Man on screen. He made his first appearance in the comic story ""Iron Man Is Born!"" Tales of Suspense #39 (March 1963) by writers Stan Lee & Larry Lieber and artists Don Heck & Jack Kirby.

Natalia Alianovna ""Natasha Romanoff"" Romanov/Black Widow, who made her first appearance in the comic story ""The Crimson Dynamo Strikes Again!"" from Tales of Suspense #52 (April 1964) by writers Stan Lee & Don Rico and artist Don Heck.

James Buchanan ""Bucky"" Barnes Jr./The Winter Soldier, referred to as Bucky Barnes or The Winter Soldier on screen. The character made his first appearance as Bucky Barns in the comic story ""Meet Captain America"" from Captain America Comics #1 (March 1941). He then became The Winter Soldier in the comic story ""Out of Time: Part 1"" from Captain America Volume 5 #1 (January 2005). The character was created by writer Joe Simon and writer/artist Jack Kirby.

Samuel Thomas ""Sam"" Wilson/The Falcon, referred to as Sam Wilson or The Falcon on screen. He made his first appearance in the comic story ""The Coming of The Falcon!"" from Captain America #117 by writer Stan Lee and artist Gene Colan.

Lieutenant James Rupert ""Rhodey"" Rhodes/War Machine, referred to as Rhodey Rhodes or War Machine on screen. He made his first appearance as James Rhodes in the comic story ""At the Mercy of My Foes Friends!"" from Iron Man #118 (January 1979), whilst he's identity of War Machine first appeared in the comic story ""Personal Demons"" from Avengers West Coast (Volume 2) #94 (May 1993). The character was created by writer David Michelinie, writer/artist Bob Layton and artist John Byrne.

Clinton Francis ""Clint"" Barton/Hawkeye, referred to as Clint Barton or Hawkeye on screen. He made his first appearance as a supervillain in the comic story ""Hawkeye, the Marksman!"" from Tales of Suspense #57 (September 1964) by writer Stan Lee and artist Don Heck. The character would later joined the Avengers as a superhero in the comic story ""The Old Order Changeth!"" from The Avengers #16 (May 1965).",Captain America: Civil War (2016)
Which side does each character take on the Superhuman Registration Act?,"In this film, there is no Superhuman Registration Act quite but the equivalent of the act is called the ""Sokovia Accords"" as it was triggered by the destruction of the city in Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015). It states that all superheroes will need to get approval to be deployed to the field after each event or activity has been reviewed or approved by the United Nations. The team members are broken down as follows.

Anti-Accords: Captain America, Scarlet Witch, Falcon, Winter Soldier, Hawkeye, Ant-Man, and Agent 13.

Pro-Accords: Iron Man, War Machine, Vision, Black Widow, Black Panther, and Spider-Man.

In the comic books, Tony Stark becomes the Pro-Registration figurehead, while Cap leads the Anti-Registration group, which is later known as ""The Secret Avengers"". Spider-Man is caught in the middle having differences with Iron Man, but also not wanting to go against the law. At first, he was convinced to join Pro-Registration by Iron Man and revealed his identity to the world. After Spider-Man assisted Iron Man in several missions (and witnessed a hero die as a result of the war along with a partnership with supervillains), he called it quits and switched to Anti-Registration with Cap. This was in addition to almost dying at the hands of Spider-Man comics villains Jack O'Lantern and the Hobgoblin, whom Iron Man was using in an effort to increase their numbers. It was not until the Punisher rescued him that he came to his senses. Promotional art of the film gave a first look at the teams. In the film, although Black Widow doesn't switch sides, she does at some point wind up willfully giving some of members of the opposite team a head start in fleeing her team's lawful attempt to arrest all of them, and toward the end, she explains her actions by presenting insubordinate philosophies to Stark. Likewise, Black Panther doesn't switch but at the end secretly provides harbor to the eventually-vindicated Winter Soldier. So, in a sense, Iron Man's support shrinks slightly, even if Cap's doesn't grow.",Captain America: Civil War (2016)
Who are the villains in the film?,"The villains are Baron Zemo (Daniel Brühl) and Brock Rumlow/Crossbones (Frank Grillo). Crossbones is once again a supporting villain, just as in Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014), having miraculously survived the collapse of the Triskalion, and blaming Steve Rogers/Captain America for the injuries he sustained. Baron Zemo is the main villain, although this is kept in the dark for a long time, and his true intentions aren't revealed until the end. ""Bucky"" Barnes, the Winter Soldier, (Sebastian Stan) starts out as a villainous character, but he becomes a close ally to Captain America later on. Similarly, T'Challa/Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) starts out as rogueish, but also becomes one of the heroes. In some ways, Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) and State Secretary Thaddeus ""Thunderbolt"" Ross (William Hurt) can be considered antiheroes.",Captain America: Civil War (2016)
How could Steve Rogers (Captain America) already know the truth about the death of Tony Stark's parents?,"During the encounter with Zola (Toby Jones) in Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014), Steve Rogers/Captain America (Chris Evans) learned that the death of Howard and Maria Stark was a hit ordered by HYDRA, who faked it as a traffic accident. At the end of the same movie, Natascha Romanoff/Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) gave Steve a Russian file about Bucky Barnes/Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan), saying that she pulled some strings with former allies to get it. The file was probably a KGB file, which could hold some clues to the Winter Soldier's current whereabouts. Since he was in the service of Russian HYDRA agents during the Cold War, the KGB may have been able to keep better track of his secret missions at the time (in Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Black Widow admits that her former Russian agency, as well as she herself, have had dealings with him). It is most likely that Steve read in (or implied from) this file that it was Bucky who executed the killing of Howard and Maria Stark; this would make sense, because if it had been explicitly stated in a secret S.H.I.E.L.D. or HYDRA file, then Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) probably would have found out himself after Black Widow dumped all secret files on the Internet at the end of Winter Soldier. Even Baron Zemo said he had to do extensive decryption on a HYDRA file to find a clue as to what happened on the night when Stark's parents died. In any case, Steve withheld this vital piece of information from Tony, knowing that Tony would make it his mission to kill Bucky, even though Bucky was brain-washed and did not know what he was doing at the time.",Captain America: Civil War (2016)
Is there a post-credits scene?,"There are actually two post-credits scenes (or more accurately: a mid-credits and a post-credits scene). In the first, Steve Rogers/Captain America and James ""Bucky"" Barnes/Winter Soldier are given shelter in the secret laboratory of T'Challa/Black Panther. Bucky voluntarily goes into stasis, in the hope that they may be able to re-program his mind, so no one can take advantage of him anymore. In the second scene, Peter Parker/Spider-Man returns home after the battle, fooling his aunt into believing that his injuries came from a fight with a school bully. He then produces a piece of communication equipment from Stark, which also casts a Spider-Man logo on the ceiling.",Captain America: Civil War (2016)
"Is ""Captain America: Civil War"" a final ""Avengers"" film?",No. Captain America: Civil War is the third installment of the Captain America trilogy while featuring members of the Avengers minus the Hulk and Thor. It is not an Avengers film. Avengers: Infinity War (2018) and Avengers: Endgame (2019) are the third and fourth (last) Avengers films.,Captain America: Civil War (2016)
"How could Zemo make the press and Iron man believe that Bucky is the one who is responsible for Vienna explosion ? "" How was Bucky framed for the explosion "" ?","This is explained briefly in the scene when Stark heads to the Raft, the prison where the heroes who sided with Captain America are imprisoned. Stark receives a message from his A.I. F.R.I.D.A.Y. stating that some facial prosthetis resembling Bucky Barnes' face was uncovered from Baron Zemo's hideout. This implies Zemo wore a facial mask to look like Bucky Barnes and deliberately walked past security cameras to be identified as Bucky, thus framing Bucky for the explosion.",Captain America: Civil War (2016)
in what order does this movie fit historically into the marvel universe? after which movie? before which movie?,It comes after Captain America: Civil War and before Guardians of the Galaxy: Vol. 2.,Doctor Strange (2016)
Does this film take place after 'Captain America: Civil War'?,Yes. The film opens with some home movies Peter made about his trip to Berlin.,Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017)
Who is the main villain in this film?,"The main villain is ""The Vulture"" (Michael Keaton). The Vulture is a classic villain from the original Marvel comic books and was originally going to appear in Sam Raimi's ""Spider-Man 4"" before that sequel was scrapped.",Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017)
Is there a post-credit scene?,"Yes, there's a mid-credit scene that sets up ""The Sinister Six"" and an inconsequential snippet with Captain America at the very end of the credits.",Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017)
Is there a post-credits scene?,There are two. The first scene occurs during the credits. Thor and Loki are discussing traveling to Earth when a giant spacecraft appears near their ship. The second scene is at the end of the credits. The Grand Master escapes from a container and declares the revolution a tie.,Thor: Ragnarok (2017)
Why did Black Widow dye her hair blonde in this film?,"Because Black Widow, Captain America, Falcon and Scarlett Witch were all in hiding since the end of Civil War. Black Widow was well-recognized with her bright red hair. So dying it a different colour would help her keep a low profile.",Avengers: Infinity War (2018)
Why isn't Wolverine in this movie?,"Because he isn't in any of the MCU films. Why would he be in this one?

Furthermore, 20th Century Fox owned the rights to the X-Men characters at this point. Before Disney acquired 20th Century. They have yet to include the X-Men in to the MCU.",Avengers: Infinity War (2018)
What will 'Infinity War' be about?,It has been speculated that the film will conclude the Thanos arc and the Infinity Stones arc and the film's plot has been speculated to be about The Avengers and the Guardians of the Galaxy joining forces to stop Thanos from destroying the universe with the six Infinity Stones.,Avengers: Infinity War (2018)
What are the Infinity Stones?,"As Wong says, ""The Big Bang sent six elemental crystals hurtling across the virgin universe. These Infinity Stones each control an essential aspect of existence: Space, Reality, Power, Soul, Mind, and Time.""

In order of first appearance in the MCU:

The Space Stone (blue) - housed in the Tesseract, which appeared post-credits in Thor (2011). In Captain America: The First Avenger (2011), the Red Skull steals the Tesseract and uses it to power weaponry. After transporting the Red Skull to Vormir, the Tesseract falls into the Arctic Ocean where it is later recovered by Howard Stark and taken to a secret base. In 1989, Dr. Wendy Lawson tries to use the Tesseract to unlock light-speed travel. In Captain Marvel (2019), it is recovered by Carol Danvers, who hands it over to S.H.I.E.L.D. In The Avengers (2012), it is shown to be capable of generating wormholes; Loki steals the Tesseract from S.H.I.E.L.D. and uses it to transport the Chitauri to New York City. After the battle, the Tesseract it is returned to Asgard and used to repair the Bifrost. Loki steals the Tesseract before Asgard's destruction in Thor: Ragnarok (2017). He gives it to Thanos in Avengers: Infinity War to save Thor's life. Thanos then crushes the Tesseract to acquire the Stone.

Mind Stone (yellow): Housed in a scepter which Thanos and the Other gave to Loki to help him conquer Earth; it allowed him to control people's minds and project energy blasts. After Loki's defeat, the scepter fell into the hands of Wolfgang von Strucker, who in the mid-credits scene of Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014) is seen using it to experiment on humans; these experiments produced Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch. In Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015), the scepter is revealed to contain the Mind Stone and has an AI that grants sentience to Ultron, who steals the scepter, removes the Stone from it, and uses it to create a newly upgraded body for himself. The Avengers steal the body from Ultron and upload J.A.R.V.I.S. into it, giving birth to ""Vision"".

The Mind Stone can also enhance the user's intelligence, grants the user immense knowledge, and can create new life. In Infinity War, Vision is injured by Thanos' children trying to get the Mind Stone and is taken to Wakanda to have it removed. Scarlet Witch is forced to destroy Vision and the Stone, only for Thanos to use the Time Stone to revive Vision and collect it, killing Vision again.

Reality Stone (red): Transformed into a fluid-like weapon called the Aether, it first appears in Thor: The Dark World (2013), where Malekith attempts to use it to destroy the Nine Realms. Jane Foster becomes infected by the Aether, and it is later drawn out of her by Malekith. After Malekith is defeated by Thor, Sif and Volstagg seal the Aether in a lantern-like container and entrust it to the Collector in order to separate it from the Tesseract. The Aether, when bonded with a host, can turn anything into dark matter, and is capable of sucking the life force out of humans and other mortals. It can also create portals to other worlds, disrupt the laws of physics, and repel threats if it senses any. In Avengers: Infinity War, Thanos acquires the Aether/Reality Stone from the Collector.

Power Stone (purple): Housed in an orb that Ronan seeks for Thanos in Guardians of the Galaxy (2014), it can increase the user's strength and destroy entire civilizations with a single blast. After Star-Lord finds and steals it from its hiding place, Ronan takes it back. After betraying Thanos, Ronan tries to use it to destroy the planet Xandar but is stopped and defeated by the Ravagers, Nova Corps, and the Guardians of the Galaxy. Due to his half-Celestial heritage, Star-Lord is able to withstand the Stone's power, particularly when the burden is shared by the other Guardians. Star-Lord kills Ronan with an energy blast from the Stone and then places it a new orb and entrusts it to the Nova Corps. Before the events of Infinity War, the Power Stone is the first to be obtained by Thanos, who ""decimates"" Xandar in the process, a scene not shown in the series as yet.

Time Stone (green): Housed in the Eye of Agamotto by Earth's first sorcerer, Agamotto. A Master of the Mystic Arts can use the Stone to alter and manipulate time. In Doctor Strange (2016), the title character finds the Eye and uses it to defeat Dormammu. Strange returns the Eye to the Masters of the Mystic Arts' secret compound Kamar-Taj, but is seen wearing it again in the mid-credits scene. During the events of Avengers: Infinity War, Thanos's lieutenants attempt to steal the Eye from Strange (who has locked it in the Eye with a simple but unbreakable spell) but are foiled by Tony Stark and Peter Parker. While on the planet Titan (Thanos's homeworld), Strange uses the Time Stone to look into future timelines, viewing millions of possible outcomes of their conflict with Thanos and sees only one future where they win. Strange later surrenders the Stone to Thanos to save Tony Stark. During the confrontation in Wakanda, Thanos uses the Time Stone to undo the Mind Stone's destruction.

Soul Stone (orange): The Soul Stone has the ability to manipulate a soul and the essence of a person. It is first seen in Avengers: Infinity War. Some time prior to Guardians of the Galaxy, Thanos tasked Gamora with finding the Soul Stone as there is little record of its existence compared to the other Infinity Stones. Gamora found it hidden on the planet Vormir, but decided not to tell Thanos and kept the secret with Nebula (little realizing that Thanos wasn't fooled). After Thanos captures and tortures Nebula, Gamora agrees to take him to Vormir, where they encounter the Red Skull (having been transported to Vormir by the Tesseract), who serves as the Stonekeeper. The Red Skull informs Thanos that he must sacrifice someone he loves to acquire the Stone. Thanos sacrifices Gamora, causing the Stone to appear in his hand.",Avengers: Infinity War (2018)
Why does Thanos want the Infinity Stones?,"Thanos seeks to rid the universe of half it's population. He has long carried on such a campaign because he sees all sentient beings as overcrowding the universe, using up all natural resources too quickly and creating poverty on a massive scale. Problems like poverty and scarcity of resources leads to war. Thanos believes the only way to preserve life is to eliminate half of it.

In the scene after Thanos has acquired the Mind stone and arrives on his home planet of Titan, he talks to Dr Strange, telling the sorcerer that Titan was once a ""paradise"" but overpopulation had led to the problems described above. When Thanos offered the rulers of Titan his solution, they considered the plan to be that of a madman and rejected it. Thanos then started his campaign across the universe, though without the stones.",Avengers: Infinity War (2018)
How was Thanos able to defeat Hulk so easily in hand to hand combat?,"Thanos is very skilled in hand-to-hand combat, more so than the Hulk, who typically shows little or no skill in that arena. Thanos has been raised to be a ruthless warrior and has learned many different combat techniques and how to use a large array of weapons. All he had to do was let the Hulk beat him for a few moments to figure out the best way to defeat the Hulk. As a result, the Hulk is traumatized and essentially goes into hiding in Banner. Additionally, Thanos already has the Power stone.",Avengers: Infinity War (2018)
"Doctor Strange saw 14,000,605 possible future scenarios. He didn't say he saw ALL, so why did he stop after viewing 1 in which they won?","No matter how many futures in which they won, Strange watched, he still would have had to choose only one to make it real and show us. Dr Strange could have watched more futures, but in the end we would have still gotten the same 2 movies. In order for us to see a different future means a different set of films, so 2 more new Avengers movies need be reshot for each future. The Producers have chosen this ""only one possible win"", so that all complaints/questions that arise are aswered with: This was the only way!",Avengers: Infinity War (2018)
"In the end credit scene, why does Maria Hill call Fury ""Nick""?","She and Fury are close friends and allies who are on first name basis. Furthermore, Maria has called Fury ""Nick"" in several other MCU films. Maria was likely in shock due to the fact she was being dusted away and forgot to call him Fury.",Avengers: Infinity War (2018)
Did Luke Cage survive the snap?,Irrelevant. Seeing as how Luke Cage isn't featured in any of the films and the marvel netflix series were cancelled. Not to mention everyone from the snap is brought back in Endgame.,Avengers: Infinity War (2018)
"What happened to Hank, Hope and Janet after Scott entered the Quantum Realm (during the credits)?",The three were turned to ash by Thanos snapping his fingers while possessing the Infinity Gauntlet and Infinity Stones -- at the end of Avengers: Infinity War.,Ant-Man and the Wasp (2018)
Why did they choose the red and blue costume instead of the classic black costume?,"You are thinking of the 'Warbird' outfit when she was 'Ms. Marvel'.

Because Carol is Captain Marvel here (and this is basically her costume from the Kelly Sue DeConnick run in the comics) , she's no longer Ms. Marvel.",Captain Marvel (2019)
"Were there actually female U.S. fighter pilots, such as Carol Danvers and Maria Rambeau, during the period shown in the movie?","In short, no. This is an anachronism for the late 1980s. Women were not permitted to fly combat aircraft until 1993. Jeannie Flynn Leavitt, who is white, was the first female to be designated a U.S. fighter pilot (F-15E) that same year. To reach the level of proficiency Carol Danvers would have had to be an experimental test pilot in 1989, she would have had to become a jet pilot no later than 1985, approximately eight years before this was possible. The character of Maria Rambeau is even more anachronistic. The first black woman to become a U.S. fighter pilot was Shawna Rochelle Kimbrell, but she did not earn this designation until August 2000.

Keep in mind. The Marvel Cinematic Universe is not the same as our world. So history has played out differently.",Captain Marvel (2019)
"Why was Mar Vell not introduced as the first captain marvel in the MCU like in the comics the same way Iron Man, Hulk, Captain America and Thor have been?","Most likely the reason is due to inter-sectional feminism becoming more prominent in hollywood content. During the 2008-2012 phase 1 era the MCU was still young and untested by audiences, and in spite of the audiences desire to see the source material be honored by the MCU--the MCU is more about pandering and trying to get more profit from younger audiences despite being intended for multi-generational audiences like Stan Lee wanted when he was still alive.",Captain Marvel (2019)
"What edits does Nick Fury make to his computer document at the end of the movie, and why?","He changes the word ""Protectors"" to ""Avengers"", keeping in terms with Danvers' Air Force callsign, despite the fact the character not being existed in the MCU up until now.",Captain Marvel (2019)
"How did the Tesseract get to the orbiting ship from the ocean, as described in Captain America?","It is speculated by some that Wendy Lawson and PEGASUS being related to S.H.I.E.L.D., she might have got access to it somehow. But it still doesn't answer the fact why S.H.I.E.L.D. hasn't gone looking for the Tesseract which has been seemingly floating in space for six years since Lawson died (an incident recorded in the Air Force records, so S.H.I.E.L.D. should obviously know about it). When Carol and the company boarded the ship where the Tesseract was at, it was abandoned. S.H.I.E.L.D.'s complete ignorance to the matter somewhat seems unrealistic as they favored the Tesseract more than anything. In fact, the agency was created around researching the Tesseract.",Captain Marvel (2019)
"Is ""Avengers: Endgame"" based on a comic book?","The film is loosely based on ""The Infinity Gauntlet"" storyline in the comic. But for the most part, is an original story made for the film. The story in the comic had Thanos wipe out life to please the personification of Death, but failed to do so. Thanos in the movie seeks to wipe out life because he thinks by doing so he can save the universe from overcrowding. Endgame is the final confrontation with him when he seeks revenge for the Avengers trying to undo his work.",Avengers: Endgame (2019)
Do I need to see all Marvel superhero movies before this to understand this movie?,"Yes. This movie is the penultimate culmination of all the 21 movies of the MCU, and if you decide to watch some of them, you may not understand the storyline because they're deeply related to other movies. Like if you watch Captain America: Civil War (2016) without watching Ant-Man (2015), you'll be confused by Ant-Man's sudden presence in Civil War. Also, if you skip Guardians of the Galaxy (2014), you won't understand Avengers: Infinity War (2018). Due to the interconnected nature of the MCU, every movie is important to fully realize the complete picture.",Avengers: Endgame (2019)
Is there a post-credit scene in Avengers: Endgame?,"They showed a deleted post credit scene when they re-released the movie, but no official scene.",Avengers: Endgame (2019)
"What did Captain ""Stevens"" refer to when he called Dr. Pym and told him he had a glowing box that made the mail guys sick?","Could be he was referring to the Tesseract as it has played a key role in the movies going back to Captain America: The First Avenger (2011). Or highly radioactive material.

Then again, considering how much ""mad science"" was going on in that place, it could have just been a generic bluff since Rogers didn't give too many details.",Avengers: Endgame (2019)
Is this going to be the final Avengers movie?,"No. This is the final time you will see many of the original Avengers. However, more Avengers movies are sure to come, especially with newer Avengers now taking the spotlight.",Avengers: Endgame (2019)
Who was the young man at the back of the crowd standing by himself at the funeral?,"He is Harley Keener, the young boy in Iron Man Three (2013) who helps Tony Stark recharge his suit, played by Ty Simpkins. Because this movie takes place about 10 years after IM3, he's now a teenager.",Avengers: Endgame (2019)
"In the last battle, who are the armies in the Avengers side which appear with the help of Dr. Strange?","Wong brings the Masters of the Mystic arts, armies of Wakanda, citizens of New Asgard, along with some ravagers from GOTG.",Avengers: Endgame (2019)
"When War Machine suggests killing baby Thanos, Hulk said that it will make a new timeline. Then how was Captain America able to meet Falcon after deciding to stay in the past?","Joe Russo has confirmed in interviews that elderly Steve found a way to make another time jump from his alternate reality with Peggy towards his original with Sam, which is left to be a mystery for now.",Avengers: Endgame (2019)
How did Nebula bring Thanos and his army into the future without Pym Particles and GPS device?,"When old, bad, Nebula defeated new, good Nebula, she acquired the Pym Particles and GPS device.",Avengers: Endgame (2019)
"The Avengers need a big machine to go back in time through the Quantum Space. But when back in time, they seem to be able to just ""jump"" around. (Tony and Captain A. goes back to 1970). How was this explained?","The machine functioned as the anchor point they would return to when they finished their mission. Tony and Cap just changed the coordinates to go further in time when they re-entered the quantum space. Each member had an extra dose of particles to jump back to their point of origin. When they failed to get the Tesseract, Cap and Tony used their remaining particles to jump back to the 70s, because Tony knew that his father and Hank Pym worked together at that facility. So they were able to get the tesseract and extra Pym particles to return to their point of origin.",Avengers: Endgame (2019)
What happened to Gamora in the end? She wasn't on the Guardians ship.,"Moments before Thor enters the Guardian's ship, we can see Quill looking at a screen with the picture of Gamora and the word 'searching' in top of it. This implies that she fled the scene and the search for her will probably be one of the main plots of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023).

One of the deleted scenes shows that she just went away while the remaining Avengers take a knee for the fallen Tony Stark.",Avengers: Endgame (2019)
How did Pepper Potts (Rescue) know to come in battle at the exact moment everybody else did?,"The same way everyone else knew (the Wakandans, the Asgardians, the Masters of the Mystic Arts, etc.). Doctor Strange, who knew how things needed to play out, rallied everyone.",Avengers: Endgame (2019)
How and more exactly where did Captain America bring back the Soul Stone to Vormir?,It isn't shown in the film. Captain America appears to return all the stones with no trouble.,Avengers: Endgame (2019)
How was Bruce able to talk in his Hulk form without turning back into his regular self?,"Bruce explains he had radiation treatment in order to merge the personas. (""Eighteen months in a gamma lab. I put the brains and the brawn together."")",Avengers: Endgame (2019)
"How was Iron Man able to ""snap out"" Thanos' entire army, doesn't the snap randomly kills off 50% of the population?",There are no predetermined rules for the snap. With all 6 stones you can do anything you want. Thanos CHOSE to wipe out half the universe. Hulk CHOSE to bring them back. Tony CHOSE to wipe Thanos and his army out of existence.,Avengers: Endgame (2019)
"In Infinity War, it was implied that Dr. Strange couldn't just portal back to Earth from Ebony Maw's ship. How then did he create a portal from Titan to Earth in Endgame?",Creating a portal while moving at an extreme speed in space is most likely impossible for Strange. Getting the ship to stop wasn't discussed after Stark refused to take control of it.,Avengers: Endgame (2019)
"Past Thanos is killed in Endgame, so how did the events depicted in Infinity War ever happen?","Hulk explains this by saying that changing the past doesn't change the future (or present). Thanos and his army dying in 2023 won't affect the main timeline but it will create another timeline in 2014 where Thanos and his army were wiped out of existence. So yes, the new 2014 timeline doesn't contain any Infinity War events.",Avengers: Endgame (2019)
Why can Captain America lift/use Thor's hammer?,"Because the very idea of Captain America is that he is the best of mankind. Not that he has powers, but that he is willing to sacrifice himself for the greater good. Hence his story arc coming to a close: a man always willing to serve, finally getting the one thing he wants most.

In an interview with Director Joss Whedon, he suggested that Captain America was always able to pick up the hammer but didn't want to shame Thor. This is why when Cap first uses the hammer in Avengers: Endgame (2019) Thor states 'I knew it.'",Avengers: Endgame (2019)
Why didn't Natasha have a funeral near the end as well?,"Some have claimed that when the team members were discussing her death (on the dock in the Avenger compound), soon after they all returned from their ""Time Heist"" missions, that this was her ""wake"" or ""funeral"". This may be more ""wishful thinking"" than an accurate description. Clearly, Tony Stark's funeral was more important to the writers, as he was the main character that the MCU was built upon.",Avengers: Endgame (2019)
Why did Tony die snapping his fingers but Bruce didn't or Thanos in the previous film?,"In the MCU both Thanos and Hulk are super beings, Hulk is often referred to as the equal of Thor in power -- remember the battle between Thor and Hulk in the first Avengers movie? Thor was able to block one of the Hulk's blows while telling him ""try to think!"". Thor can hold his own against beings as big and strong as the Hulk because he's already very strong as an immortal being.

Tony Stark is an ordinary human being. As referenced in Guardians of the Galaxy (2014) no mere mortal can survive the power of the stones, as was shown by the fate of The Collector's assistant when she grabbed one of the stones and was vaporised. Tony was said to be slightly protected by his suit but this didn't save his life since he simply wasn't vaporised instantly.",Avengers: Endgame (2019)
"Why wasn't Goose the Flerkin at Tony Stark's funeral too? Or Dr. Erik Selvig? Or Ti Asha, the blue girl Quill flirted with back on Xandar? Wouldn't the scene have been even more sad with even more characters in attendance?","We don't really know who was there, the camera was always pretty close to the people we did see so there's possibly people out of frame we didn't see.

As for why a larger funeral wasn't depicted it can be assumed that the writers wanted to make the funeral feel more personal.",Avengers: Endgame (2019)
"Captain America lifting Mjölnir is fine, but how is he able to produce lightning? Wasn't it established in a previous movie that those powers come from Thor himself (a.k.a. the God of Thunder), and not from his hammer?","The enchantment Odin placed upon Mjölnir in Thor (2011) went ""Whosoever holds of this hammer, if he be worthy, shall possess the power of Thor.""

The hammer acts as a guidance tool for Thor himself to properly focus the power which comes from within him, but the hammer also bestows power on whomever else it deems worthy as well. Whether that energy given to Captain America is equal to that of Thor's remains unknown, though unlikely.",Avengers: Endgame (2019)
"So in the film Captain America goes into the past and lives out his days as Agent Carters secret husband, this would seem to put his later relationship with agent 13 (Carter's own great niece) in a rather creepy light. As she would in fact be his own great grand niece.","In some ways, a little bit, but not really. While Steve Rogers did marry Peggy in an alternate timeline, this was established to be simply a parallel reality where he lived as her husband, completely incongruuous to the main timeline of events as we know it, so for all events as we know them, Steve and Sharon remain unrelated.

As for the alternate timeline with Steve and Peggy growing old together, whether they even had kids in said timeline is never revealed, so there is a chance, by extension, that Sharon never existed in that timeline or grew up to be a different person entirely. In either case, the events of that timeline are separate from the main timeline we all know about and remain separate as Captain America uses the last of the Pym Particles to return to the main timeline as an old man. When traveling back in time to ""get some of that life Tony was talking about,"" it is unlikely that Cap had Sharon in mind and simply wanted to be with his lost love.

There is also the fact that Cap and Sharon never actually ""dated"" or shared any real relationship, outside of briefly working together and occasionally flirting.",Avengers: Endgame (2019)
"How was it okay for Smart Hulk to reveal the future to the Ancient One, if the Avengers weren't supposed to talk about the future in the past?","The rule about not mentioning future events is in place because people in the past might act differently when they know what is going to happen, and their acting differently might mean that the event that was described to them never happens at all (which is a paradox).

However, the Ancient One seems not to experience time the same way. She already has some knowledge of things that will happen in the future, as evidenced by her knowing Stephen Strange will be her successor, and saying that he is supposed to be the best of the Sorcerers. She is also the keeper of the Time Stone, which puts her relation to time and knowledge on a more loose basis.",Avengers: Endgame (2019)
"Why did Tony say ""I am Iron Man"", before snapping his fingers was there any symbolism.","It was in retort to Thanos saying ""I am inevitable"" before snapping his fingers. It was also a call back to the first Iron Man (2008) film that ends with him admitting to the world that he was Iron Man, which set him on a path that led him to that final moment in Endgame.",Avengers: Endgame (2019)
"Why wouldn't Natasha allow Clint to sacrifice himself on Vormir, instead sacrificing herself.","Probably because of two things. One, Clint has a family. Two, Natasha has ""red on her ledger"" as she told Loki in The Avengers (2012). This is her way of wiping the red off.",Avengers: Endgame (2019)
Why were none of the Nova Corp members (who were first seen in Guardians of the Galaxy (2014)) not present in the final battle?,"Thanos attacked Xandar and obtained the Power Stone before the events of Avengers: Infinity War (2018), which is clear because he already has it at the beginning of that movie during the attack on the Asgardian ship. It's possible that his army destroyed the entire Nova Corps army, or weakened them enough so that they could not fight in the final battle.

It's also possible that neither Doctor Strange, nor any of the other Sorcerers knew of the existence of the Nova Corps, and therefore did not make a portal through which they could join the fight.",Avengers: Endgame (2019)

Accepting the premise that the past cannot be changed how is it that Thanos and all his minions have dual demises? How can they die twice?,"Technically, they didn't. In the movie, when Thanos and his army jump from the past to the present, they create a big enough impact on the time stream to create a parallel timeline, or alternate versions of themselves. In that timeline, Thanos and his army disappeared from the past, reappeared in the present and were defeated. So that VERSION of them died once.

In the main timeline, it played out as shown before, so that is how the ORIGINAL VERSIONS perished.

In the longer term, parallel timelines eventually fade and merge back with the main timeline, which is why our memories of the past fade and change. Even recorded history changes aspect generationally.

In reality, time is not like a stream, but an ocean. When you make a small decision, like what color socks to wear today, it has the same effect as a rain drop in the ocean. However, when momentous actions are taken, the effects are like tsunamis or tidal waves. They wash up on shore to various degrees of impact, then gradually recede back to the oceanic pool over time.",Avengers: Endgame (2019)
"How is it that in the first Guardians of the Galaxy movie, it is made very clear that no mortal could hold an Infinity Stone but now all of a sudden in this movie, everyone can hold one in their hand with no trouble at all?","The only mortal to hold a stone is Hawkeye, who receives the soul stone in exchange for that which he loves. The space stone is housed by the tesseract, the reality stone is extracted in the form of the aether, the mind stone is in Loki's staff, the time stone is retrieved by Hulk (who is powerful enough to wield all the stones), and the power stone is still in the orb from Guardians of the Galaxy.

In fact, the scene where Hawkeye awakens in the pool and realizes he's holding a stone in his hand is more powerful when you realize, as he realizes, that this is the tiny, haunting payment for Natasha's sacrifice - he can now possess the tiny soul stone harmlessly.",Avengers: Endgame (2019)
"In 2016's Doctor Strange, the Ancient One refused to train Strange when he visited Kamar-Taj. If she knew the prophecy about the stone in 2012, why would she refuse to teach him?",It was just a test. She wanted to test his perseverance and willpower.,Avengers: Endgame (2019)
Were Steve and Peggy dancing in the soul world at the end?,"No, it was the alternate timeline he created after returning the stones.",Avengers: Endgame (2019)
watching endgame i see during the scene after Thanos returns after the Hulk snap we see the gauntlet being pursued by Thanos's 4 armed troops. How do they get down to the avengers compound? Dont they normally get transported in those giant siege tower spacecraft we see in infinity war?. How do they seem to be in the tunnels chasing Hawk-eye almost immediately?,"I believe it's because has sort of teleporting beam coming from his ships, meaning he could beam down his troops, who are seen as fast creatures, and they got into the Avengers base.",Avengers: Endgame (2019)
"during the final battle when everyone who thanos snapped away, Dr Strange, spiderman etc come back from Titan via Dr Strange's cosmic sparkle rings. Surely if he could do this why wait until now? In infinity war he could have brought himself, Spiderman and Ironman back to earth when they realise they couldnt turn the ship around right?","Well, he and the others on Titan were blipped. I suppose they had a little time, but they were worn out and injured from fighting, and trying to formulate a plan, then Dr. Strange was dusted, so he never got the chance to teleport them away. It wouldn't have mattered much anyway, seeing as he would have gotten blipped either way.",Avengers: Endgame (2019)
why at the end of endgame when Peter Parker returns to school is he of equivalent age to his classmates? Surely he should be 5 years younger than 50% of them although there is no sign of this.,The 5 year older people would... no longer be in highschool.,Avengers: Endgame (2019)
"If changing the past simply creates a separate reality, how can Steve appear in the main timeline as an old man when he goes back to be with Peggy?","At first, this does seem to contradict the established rules of time travel in the film. However, there is a plausible explanation - assuming that interfering with the past does indeed create a separate reality, then Steve lived out the next 80 or so years in this alternate universe where he settled down with Peggy. Then when the time came (years after Peggy's death and around the same time Tony's death took place in the original timeline), he could have requested help from Hank Pym or Doctor Strange - both of whom have ways of accessing other dimensions - to return to the ""main timeline"", and assure his friends that he was OK before presumably dying.

While this is a somewhat convoluted explanation, it is plausible enough to address the ""plot hole"" - and also creates the opportunity for Steve to have fixed a few things in his ""new timeline"" (such as exposing HYDRA and therefore rescuing Bucky), rather than remain quiet about them for the sake of maintaining continuity.",Avengers: Endgame (2019)
"How much time has elapsed since Ant Man showed up at Avengers HQ until the lunch at Stark's house? The reason I'm asking is that Natasha's hair went from completely blond to half red, like you'd expect after several months at least.","This is incorrect, Nat has her white hair from Infinity War in the scenes set in 2018, and her regular hair in all scenes set after the time jump to 2023.",Avengers: Endgame (2019)

Is J.K. Simmons the only actor from Sam Raimi's Spiderman trilogy to make an appearance in this Spider Man installment?,"While there are several crew members and a few producers who are credited with one or more of Raimi's Spider-Man movies and this one, J.K. Simmons is the only actor so credited. If any other actors have crossed over (as the same or different characters), they were not credited in both appearances and have escaped notice thus far.

As for other modern Spider-Man movies, there are similarly no crossover actors credited between either The Amazing Spider-Man (2012) or Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, and Spider-Man: Far from Home (2019). There is one crossover actor from The Amazing Spider-Man 2 (2014): Pat Kiernan, who has played a newscaster under his own name in a plethora of movies, including several Marvel movies, appeared in this capacity in both of these two films.",Spider-Man: Far from Home (2019)
Did Michael Keaton make an appearance in this movie?,No. But he will potentially return in the Morbius movie.,Spider-Man: Far from Home (2019)
"After the time skip that takes place in End Game, how are all of Peter's friend still of same age? At least 50% of them should have aged, right?","We only know of 4 associates (calling 'Flash' a friend is a real stretch) of his who were affected by the snap; Flash, MJ, Ned, and Aunt May (if we add in Nick Fury then we also add in Tony Stark, Maria Hill, etc. so let's keep it to people immediately around him). Most of the other characters are unknown with the exception of Brad Davis (Peter and Ned talk about how strange it is to see him older), Mr. Dell (whose wife faked being wiped out by the snap in order to get away from him), and Happy who grew a beard during the period.

That's relatively close to 50%. What's more, because of statistical clustering there would be plenty of times when the number of people someone knew would have either a disproportionately high number of people affected or unaffected by the snap. If you throw 10 coins in the air the odds that you will see something 'suspicious' (3 or fewer heads or tails) is about 35%.",Spider-Man: Far from Home (2019)
"Mysterio reveals Spider-man's real name but in Sam Raimi's trilogy when Harry blamed Peter for the death of his father, how come Harry never revealed to the public Peter is Spider-man if he was truly holding grudges against him?","1.

Without some kind of proof, no one would believe him.",Spider-Man: Far from Home (2019)

"Do you have to know about Marvel Studio's comic characters to 'get the jokes', understand the references, or will 'stuff' go over my head, and I won't get what was meant?","The best answer here is not really, but there is an additional level of understanding you get from the first few episodes if you've read the comics. I don't think it's necessary to enjoy the show.

The show does reference events in Avengers: Age of Ultron, Infinity War, and Endgame, as well as Captain Marvel.",WandaVision (2021)
Do you have to see this TV show before watching Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness to understand that film?,"Yes, it will be better to see this show before watching both Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021) and Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness (2022) because the story will continue in these films.",WandaVision (2021)
When can we see this on British TV?,Already available for streaming on Disney+. Will most likely never be shown on terrestrial TV.,WandaVision (2021)
Will it be released on Blu-Ray or DVD?,"Presumably, but most of the MCU-related Television/Streaming series have gotten very limited releases on Blu-Ray and DVD, and since most Streaming Series and Original Movies on other streaming sites rarely are released on Disc format, it seems unlikely that WandaVision and the other upcoming Marvel Streaming Shows will receive releases on Blu-Ray or DVD.

Is Evan Peters' character really Pietro Maximoff?,"At the end of the show it is revealed he is not really a Multiverse version of Pietro Maximoff. He is a man called Ralph Bohner who lives in the house Agatha inhabits. Agatha plays mind tricks on him to portray Wanda's brother Pietro a.k.a. Quicksilver. This storyline could evolve in him actually being a variant of Quicksilver from a different universe, although this is never confirmed in this show.",WandaVision (2021)

"If Sharon is the Power Broker, Why did she kill Selby and put a bounty on her friends' head?","This is just a guess. But when Sam, Bucky and Baron Zemo first go into Madripoor, there is a sign saying ""The Power Broker is watching you!"" This could mean Sharon aka Power Broker (Where do they come up with these names anyway???) had all of Madripoor in her hand (understandable since her aunt was Peggy, the founding member of SHIELD) and knows why her friends came to Madripoor and what they were doing there (Getting more info on Super Soldiers). She felt that by framing them and forcing their hand and then revealing herself (a friendly face) they would throw in with her and ""LEAD HER TO KARLI MORGENTHAU"" or at least the Flag Smashers. Remember, she took in Karli and was a mentor to her. Karli's betrayal hurt her and she wanted revenge!",The Falcon and the Winter Soldier (2021)
"If Sharon is The Power Broker, Why did she let Nagel die and why didn't she find another way to give the info about Karli?","I'm not sure, but I think Baron Zemo suspected her from the start. Remember he said he had friends in High Town and there must have been a time when somebody had tipped him off to who was the Real Power Broker, or he knew from the start. As he couldn't target Sharon directly and invite Bucky's or Sam's wrath on him, he targeted Nagel instead when Sharon was distracted. Sharon didn't suspect Zemo would kill Nagel when he did and she seemed genuinely shocked as well.",The Falcon and the Winter Soldier (2021)
Why did Zemo let Bucky find him so easily?,"Zemo is a man focusing all his attention into the mission, which was to end the supersoldier program and kill all the Flag Smashers group. Once he succeded, he has no reason to stay underground. Afterall, it was hinted that he could escape prison easily if he wants to.

Also, he did the same thing at the end of ""Captain America: Civil War"", when he was captured by T'challa.",The Falcon and the Winter Soldier (2021)
"Will there be a second season, or even third, fourth?","After last episode credits, its hinted there will be a new ""Captain America and The Winter Soldier"" movie, but this time, with Sam as the new Captain America.

How come we never got to know about the Red Guardian? Is he a super soldier like Captain America as well? If he is also a super soldier then why didn't we learn anything about him in The Falcon and The Winter Soldier?,"(From someone who hasn't seen that TV show): The only things that can be deduced from what is mentioned in this film is that Dreykov evidently went to great lengths to keep Red Guardian undercover or in sleeper cells, and as such unknown to the public or authorities. Then, once his final mission was completed, Dreykov started to see him as a threat and somehow managed to get him confined in prison.",Black Widow (2021)
Who is this Valentina that appears out of nowhere in the final scene?,She first appears in Falcon and the Winter Soldier. She recruits certain individuals to her organisation. But her motivations are not made clear.,Black Widow (2021)

Why does Ross not contain Natasha when he finally catches up with her the second time? Isn't she supposed to be a fugitive from direct imprisonment?,"A deleted scene from the Blu-ray featurettes reveal Natasha escapes shortly after being apprehended by Ross. He also witnesses the Red Room remains and congratulates Natasha for bringing down Dreykov. This scene was crucial to tie up loose ends in the movie, not sure why Marvel cut this hugely important scene.",Black Widow (2021)
Who exactly is 'Shang-Chi'?,"Shang-Chi is a Marvel Comics character that was created in the 1970s and was the first Asian character from that publisher to headline his own solo series in ""The Hands of Shang-Chi, Master of Kung Fu.""

In his original conception, using a property license from the estate of author Sax Rohmer, Shang-Chi is the son of the notorious Chinese would-be world conqueror, Fu Manchu. Raised to be his father's naively loyal minion and assassin, Shang-Chi met Manchu's sworn enemy, Sir Denis Nayland Smith, on a mission and learned from him the evil true nature of his father. Profoundly revolted by this discovery, Shang-Chi dedicated his life to stopping his father as part of British Intelligence.

Eventually, the license to Sax Rohmer's literary creations lapsed and Shang-Chi's association with Fu Manchu has been firmly downplayed and rewritten. Thus, the Iron Man supervillain, The Mandarin, who was an obvious Fu Manchu imitation in his original conception, will be depicted in the equivalent role in the film, allowing him to finally be openly used in the Marvel Cinematic Universe franchise considering his presence will be counterbalanced by an Asian hero. Shang-Chi in Marvel Comics now appears in sporadic limited series and guest appearances in various series doing things such as training superheroes like Spider-Man during a time when his Spider-Sense was not working and fighting as a member of the Avengers.

His abilities include a mastery of various martial arts to the point that he is considered the best hand-to-hand combat expert in the Marvel Universe on the basis of skill alone. This is contrasted with other skilled fighters in the Marvel Universe have additional factors in their favor like Captain America with his Project Rebirth body enhancements, Black Panther's heart shaped herb abilities, Iron Fist's flashy Chi affinity and superpowered heroes like Spider-Man and Daredevil. Regardless, even with his normal human attributes, Shang-Chi is so effective with his skills that he has taken on super-powered opponents like the Thing of the Fantastic Four and proved more than a match.",Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings (2021)

How come only Trevor can talk with Morris?,He probably learnt to understand him during all the years they spent together. Or maybe Morris learnt to trust Trevor and so allowed him to magically understand him.,Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings (2021)
Has Marvel Studios made any plans for a 'Moon Knight' film?,"At Disney's D23 Expo in Summer 2019, a new Moon Knight series was confirmed for release on Disney+ streaming service. However, all details about cast, production, and release date are still unannounced. Oscar Isaac has been cast as the lead.",Eternals (2021)
Will it be based on primarily the original Jack Kirby comics or the Neil Gaiman comics from the 90s?,"The film isn't focused on any comics specifically, as it creates new stakes for itself while being completely separated from the comic book counterparts. Moreover, the genders of Eternals like Ajak and Makkari are changed to females, whereas they were males in both the Kirby and Gaiman versions of the Eternals series.",Eternals (2021)
Any plans for a sequel?,"As of 2023, no confirmation has been given by Marvel Studios. In 2022, Pip the Troll voice actor Patton Oswalt claimed that Chloe Zhao would be returning to direct the sequel with all the original cast returning. However, Kingo actor Kumail Nanjiani debunked his claims and said that Oswalt might have got the information from online rumors.",Eternals (2021)
How Accurate to the original comics by Jack Kirby is this film?,"Not at all. It is revealed that the planet Earth was created to be an incubator for a Celestial, and that the Eternals and Deviants were created by the other Celestials to monitor the world and make sure the emerging population was big enough so that it could awaken the Celestial at their own expense.

In the original comics by Jack Kirby, the Eternals and Deviants were created by the Celestials along with humanity as an experiment. The Celestials essentially genetically modified and rapidly evolved chimpanzees into the first humans, then used the genetic templates to create the Eternals and Deviant races, which would represent the extreme physical good and worse of humanity. The Eternals are tasked with guiding humanity while the Deviants are discarded for rebelling against their Celestial creators in a violent war. However, the Deviants create an underwater city kingdom known as Lemuria while the Eternals live on a city in the mountains, led by Zuras.

Also, in the comics, the Eternals and Deviants are capable of reproduction and are much similar to the New Gods of DC Comics (appropriate, since Jack Kirby created both the Eternals and the New Gods). They have their own civilizations and societies, as previously stated, also. The leader of the Deviants in the comics is not Kro, but he is a high-ranked member of the Deviant societal hierarchy as he is their Military Commander. Kro also is famously in a not-really secret romance with Thena, the daughter of Zuras, which the film completely omits.

In short, the film is not accurate at all to Jack Kirby's original comics.",Eternals (2021)
Why is the critical reception of this movie so divisive?,"The critics certainly did not like this movie, at least the 47% rating on Rotten Tomatoes says so. There can be multiple reasons behind. First of all, Chloe Zhao just came off fresh after winning the Best Director and Best Picture Oscars in the 93rd Academy Awards for the indie flick Nomadland (2020). Critics adored Zhao's directional style in that movie, so they expected the same in Eternals.

However, with Eternals being a commercial movie and part of a large film franchise, her visions for the film felt short and unimpactful overall. The characterization and runtime of the movie were the biggest criticisms of the film. Putting ten new characters in an already overlong two and a half hour movie put off many critics. The writing also felt questionable in their eyes. As Druig actor Barry Keoghan put it, Eternals was a new kind of MCU movie, something that neither the critics and audiences were ready for. The movie getting banned and censored in foreign countries also didn't help to save face, either. Many even compared the movie's divisiveness to the still-controversial DCEU film Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016), where the director delivered something vastly different than expectations.",Eternals (2021)

Tobey Maguire's Peter addressed Doc Ock but why didn't he speak to Norman Osborn at all? And why didn't he react while hearing Dr. Connor's name?,"Norman Osborn showed up at the end of the movie (after Tobey appeared) and they did have a brief scene after Osborn was ""cured"".

How did Gorr know Jane was dying?,"Because he had been gradually corrupted by the power of his sword for many years so presumably it had given him some kind of insight into suffering (he only realized it when he was up close to her). The sword must have given him some kind of psychic ability. Thor also only realized her health was fragile, again this was when he was physically up close to her. In that case he realized the connection between her health and Mjolnir. Maybe Mjolnir conveyed this to him psycically.",Thor: Love and Thunder (2022)
Why did was Jane using Thor's power through Mjolnir kill her but not any of the other people who have wielded it?,"The idea is that using the powers of the Mjölnir uses too much of Jane's energy, depleting her of her strength and leaving her even more vulnerable to her cancer. In the comics, it is further explained that when she transforms into Thor, her body is purged from all toxins, including the ones from chemotherapy, effectively setting to zero all progress from her medical treatment.",Thor: Love and Thunder (2022)

"Co-producer Nate Moore has teased the existence of a potential director's cut of the movie. If it does exist, when can it be expected to be released?","Not just Black Panther 2, but almost every MCU movie have some sort of an alternate extended version. This was seen in the case of Doctor Strange: In the Multiverse of Madness (2022) where many previously unseen footages have resurfaced on social media, courtesy of stunt coordinators and VFX artists. Now, even if Nate Moore confirmed the existence of a director's cut, it is highly unlikely to ever be released as Disney never releases extended cuts of their MCU movies (minus the Spider-Man movies, as they are handled by Sony).",Black Panther: Wakanda Forever (2022)
"With a little over $800 million gross, is this movie considered a box office disappointment compared to the almost $1.4 billion gross of the original?","It's difficult to say definitively whether ""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"" is considered a box office disappointment compared to the original ""Black Panther."" Box office performance can be influenced by a variety of factors, including the state of the global economy, competition from other films, and changes in audience preferences. However, it's worth noting that ""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"" earned over 800 million dollars worldwide, which is still a substantial amount of money. Ultimately, whether a film is considered a box office success or disappointment depends on various factors and perspectives, and can vary among different people and industries.",Black Panther: Wakanda Forever (2022)
Does the role played by Chadwick Boseman in the first movie return for this sequel?,"T'Challa is revealed to have died from a disease in the film. Shuri takes over the mantle for the final fight against the Talocans. In the post-credits scene, it is revealed that T'Challa had a son all along who was never brought up or even hinted at in the original Black Panther, and his name is Touissant, known as T'Challa II in Wakanda. Touissant may take up the Black Panther mantle in the future.",Black Panther: Wakanda Forever (2022)
"Why, all of a sudden, it's revealed that T'Challa had a secret son all along? When was he even born?","It was most likely done to recast T'Challa in a more meaningful way in the future. After star Chadwick Boseman's death in 2020, Marvel Studios chose not to recast T'Challa with a new actor, out of respect for Boseman. Director Ryan Coogler then chose to eventually pass on the mantle to a new T'Challa in a meaningful way, and then he came up with the idea of T'Challa having a son and an heir to the throne.

As for Touissant's birth time, it can be presumed that Nakia was pregnant with him before the events of Avengers: Infinity War (2018) and was moved out from Wakanda for her safety by T'Challa. This explains Nakia's absence in that film. She raised Touissant while T'Challa was Blipped out by Thanos.",Black Panther: Wakanda Forever (2022)

"How come there isn't time(and space) in the quantum realm? The portal to Earth, that Janet opened, was open for a distinct period of time, if Kang came earlier he could have escaped, if Hope had came back later, Kang could have escaped.","The Quantum Realm is a different place from our universe, with different rules, that can only be reached by shrinking down to quantum-level sizes. It is not clear how time and space work in the Quantum Realm, as they are affected by quantum phenomena such as superposition and entanglement. Nothing in the Quantum Realm happens at a specific place or time until it is measured, and parts of a quantum system separated by space or time can still interact with each other.

The portal to Earth that Janet opened was created by using Kang's power core, which is a device that can manipulate the Quantum Realm and travel across the multiverse. The power core is based on Kang's knowledge of quantum physics, which may be different from ours. Therefore, we do not know how the portal works exactly, or how long it stays open. It is possible that the portal is affected by quantum fluctuations or interference from other realities.

Kang came earlier than Janet expected, because he had a device that could track the power core's location and energy signature. He also had a device that could override Janet's control of the portal and open it himself. However, he was delayed by Scott and Hope, who fought him and destroyed his power core. Hope came back later than Scott expected, because she had to fight Kang's forces and rescue her parents. She also had to use her own suit's regulator to shrink down to quantum size and enter the portal.",Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania (2023)
"Why is Gamora still alive in this film when her 'alternate self' should no longer exist with the death of Thanos and her present self sacrificed herself to ensure that. According to Bruce Banner and The Ancient one, these alternate selves should no longer exist. Other characters who died the same way have stayed dead.","Because the ""alternate selves"" are from the past. However, this version of time travel seen in Endgame posits that when they travel back in time, they are in fact travelling to a different, parallel dimension. Anything the Avengers do to alter the past in that timeline will not effect their original timeline. The Ancient One didn't want to give Bruce the time stone because she feared it would leave her timeline defenseless. Every event that happened during their time travel would have somewhat altered the future of THAT timeline. Not the original one we've been following since Iron Man in 2008.

So Thanos wiping out half of all life still happened, Thanos throwing Gamora off the cliff to secure the soul stone still happened, Thor decapitating Thanos still happened.

2014 Thanos brings his armies and his daughters; Gamora and Nebula with him to the 2023 of the main Avengers timeline but again, this is dimensional time travel not linear time travel like in back to the future. So when 2023 Nebula kills 2014 Nebula, she doesn't disappear because this is simply a different Nebula. Likewise, when Tony wipes out 2014 Thanos and his army, he wouldn't have wiped out Gamora because he was aware she was helping them. This Gamora is now stranded in 2023 without having lived the events of the first Guardians of the Galaxy movie. The Gamora that Thanos threw off the cliff in Infinity War is still dead.",Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023)
The past version (2014) of Gamora should have turned to dust after the Endgame snap to reverse what Thanos had done in Infinity War - is (past) Gamora alive or dead? How?,"The infinity gauntlet with all the stones allow the wielder to pretty much do anything imaginable. Tony used it to wipe out Thanos' army. But even though Tony never met either version of Gamora, he knew she was a member of the Guardians of the Galaxy and that she meant a lot to Peter Quill and the rest of the team. Tony spent a lot of time stranded in space with Nebula. It's entirely possible she told him about Gamora. So when Tony snapped his fingers, he would have specifically chosen to avoid wiping Gamora out with the rest of Thanos' army. Knowing that she became an ally. Much like Nebula.",Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023)
